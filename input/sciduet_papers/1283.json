{"title": "Automatic Metric Validation for Grammatical Error Correction", "abstract": "Metric validation in Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is currently done by observing the correlation between human and metric-induced rankings. However, such correlation studies are costly, methodologically troublesome, and suffer from low inter-rater agreement. We propose MAEGE, an automatic methodology for GEC metric validation, that overcomes many of the difficulties with existing practices. Experiments with MAEGE shed a new light on metric quality, showing for example that the standard M 2 metric fares poorly on corpus-level ranking. Moreover, we use MAEGE to perform a detailed analysis of metric behavior, showing that correcting some types of errors is consistently penalized by existing metrics.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Much recent effort has been devoted to automatic evaluation, both within GEC (Napoles et al., 2015;
