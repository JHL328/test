{"title": "ACBiMA: Advanced Chinese Bi-Character Word Morphological Analyzer", "abstract": "While morphological information has been demonstrated to be useful for various Chinese NLP tasks, there is still a lack of complete theories, category schemes, and toolkits for Chinese morphology. This paper focuses on the morphological structures of Chinese bi-character words, where a corpus were collected based on a welldefined morphological type scheme covering both Chinese derived words and compound words.
