{"title": "Neural AMR: Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Parsing and Generation", "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad range of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating text using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the relatively limited amount of labeled data and the nonsequential nature of the AMR graphs. We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs. For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the current best score reported without significant use of external semantic resources. For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of BLEU 33.8. We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong evidence that sequencebased AMR models are robust against ordering variations of graph-to-sequence conversions. 157", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism to encode the meaning of natural language text."}, {"id": 1, "string": "As shown in Figure 1 , AMR represents the meaning using a directed graph while abstracting away the surface forms in text."}, {"id": 2, "string": "AMR has been used as an intermediate meaning representation for several applications including machine translation (MT) (Jones et al., 2012) , summarization (Liu et al., 2015) , sentence compression (Takase et al., 2016) , and event extraction (Huang et al., 2016) ."}, {"id": 3, "string": "While AMR allows for rich semantic representation, annotating training data in AMR is expensive, which in turn limits the use Obama was elected and his voters celebrated Figure 1 : An example sentence and its corresponding Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)."}, {"id": 4, "string": "AMR encodes semantic dependencies between entities mentioned in the sentence, such as \"Obama\" being the \"arg0\" of the verb \"elected\"."}, {"id": 5, "string": "of neural network models (Misra and Artzi, 2016;
