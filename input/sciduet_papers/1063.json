{"title": "Analyzing Linguistic Differences between Owner and Staff Attributed Tweets", "abstract": "Research on social media has to date assumed that all posts from an account are authored by the same person. In this study, we challenge this assumption and study the linguistic differences between posts signed by the account owner or attributed to their staff. We introduce a novel data set of tweets posted by U.S. politicians who self-reported their tweets using a signature. We analyze the linguistic topics and style features that distinguish the two types of tweets. Predictive results show that we are able to distinguish between owner and staff attributed tweets with good accuracy, even when not using any training data from that account.", "text": [{"id": 0,

status (Aletras and Chamberlain, 2018) , race (Preo\u0163iuc-Pietro and Ungar, 2018) or personality (Schwartz et al., 2013a; Preo\u0163iuc-Pietro et al., 2016 )."}, {"id": 17, "string": "Related to our task is authorship attribution, where the goal is to predict the author of a given text."}, {"id": 18, "string": "With few exceptions (Schwartz et al., 2013b) , this was attempted on larger

most authorship attribution studies, differences between authors consist mainly of the topics they write about."}, {"id": 21, "string": "Our experimental setup limits the extent to which topic presence impacts the prediction, as all tweets are posted by US politicians and within the topics of the tweets from an account should be similar to each other."}, {"id": 22, "string": "Pastiche detection is another related area of research (Dinu et al., 2012) , where models are trained to distinguish between an original text and a text written by one who aims to imitate the style of the original author, resulting in the documents having similar topics."}, {"id": 23, "string": "Data We build a data set of Twitter accounts used by both the owner (the person who the account represents)

example of Barack Obama (Time, 2011) ."}, {"id": 25, "string": "The rest of the tweets are implicitly attributed to their staff."}, {"id": 26, "string": "Thus, we use the Twitter user description to identify potential accounts where owners sign their tweets."}, {"id": 27, "string": "We collect in total 1,365 potential user descriptions from Twitter that match a set of keyphrases indicative of personal tweet signatures (i.e., tweets by me signed, tweets signed, tweets are signed, staff unless noted, tweets from staff unless signed, tweets signed by, my tweets are signed)."}, {"id": 28,

(Ekman, 1992; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008; Strapparava et al., 2004) which posits the existence of six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise."}, {"id": 56, "string": "We automatically quantify these emotions from our Twitter data set using a publicly available crowd-sourcing derived lexicon of words associated with any of the six emotions, as well as general positive and negative sentiment Turney, 2010, 2013) ."}, {"id": 57, "string": "Using these models, we assign sentiment and emotion probabilities to each message."}, {"id": 58, "string": "Unigrams."}, {"id": 59, "string": "We use the bag-of-words representation to reduce each message to a normalised frequency distribution over the vocabulary consisting of all words used by at least 20% of the users (2,099 words in total)."}, {"id": 60, "string": "We chose this smaller vocabulary that is more representative of words used by a larger set of users such that models would be able to transfer better to unseen users."}, {"id": 61, "string": "Tweet Features."}, {"id": 62, "string": "We compute additional tweetlevel features such as: the length in characters and tokens (Length), the type of tweet encoding if this is an @-reply or contains a URL (Tweet Type), the time of the tweet represented as a one-hot vector over the hour of day and day of week (Post Time) and the number of retweets and likes the tweet received (Impact)."}, {"id": 63, "string": "Although the latter features are not available in a real-time predictive scenario, they are useful for analysis."}, {"id": 64, "string": "Prediction Our hypothesis is that tweets attributed to the owner of the account are different than those attributed to staff, and that these patterns generalize to held-out accounts not included in the training data."}, {"id": 65, "string": "Hence, we build predictive models and test them in two setups."}, {"id": 66, "string": "First, we split the users into ten folds."}, {"id": 67, "string":

ten folds."}, {"id": 70, "string": "Due to class imbalance -only 4.8% of tweets are posted by the account owners -results are measured in ROC AUC, which is a more suitable metric in this setup."}, {"id": 71, "string": "In our predictive experiments, we used logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization."}, {"id": 72, "string": "As features, we use all feature types described in the previous section separately as well as together using a logistic regression model combining all feature sets (Combined)."}, {"id": 73, "string": "The results using both experimental setups -holding-out tweets or users -are presented in Table 1 ."}, {"id": 74, "string": "Results show that we can predict owner tweets with good performance and consistently better than chance, even when we have no training data for the users in the test set."}, {"id": 75, "string": "The held-out user experimental setup is more challenging as reflected by lower predictive numbers for most language features, except for the LIWC features."}, {"id": 76, "string": "One potential explanation for the high performance of the LIWC features in this setup is that these are low dimensional and are better at identifying general patterns which transfer better to unseen users rather than overfit the users from the training data."}, {"id": 77, "string": "Table 1 : Predictive results with each feature type
