{"title": "Automatic Extraction of Parallel Speech Corpora from Dubbed Movies", "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to extract parallel speech corpora based on any language pair from dubbed movies, together with an application framework in which some corresponding prosodic parameters are extracted. The obtained parallel corpora are especially suitable for speech-to-speech translation applications when a prosody transfer between source and target languages is desired.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction The availability of large parallel corpora is one of the major challenges in developing translation systems."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Bilingual corpora, which are needed to train statistical translation models, are harder to acquire than monolingual corpora since they presuppose the implication of labour in translation or interpretation."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Working in the speech domain introduces even more difficulties since interpretations are not sufficient to capture the paralinguistic aspects of speech."}, {"id": 3, "string": "Several attempts have been recently made to acquire spoken parallel corpora of considerable size."}, {"id": 4, "string": "However, these corpora either do not reflect the prosodic aspects in the interpreted speech or do not carry the traits of natural speech."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Or they simply do not align well the source and the target language sides."}, {"id": 6, "string": "To account for this deficit, we propose to exploit dubbed movies where expressive speech is readily available in multiple languages and their corresponding aligned scripts are easily accessible through subtitles."}, {"id": 7, "string": "Movies and TV shows have been a good resource for collecting parallel bilingual data because of the availability and open access of subtitles in different languages."}, {"id": 8, "string": "With 1850 bitexts of 65 languages, the OpenSubtitles project (Lison and Tiedemann, 2016) is the largest re-source of translated movie subtitles compiled so far."}, {"id": 9, "string": "The time information in subtitles makes it easy to align sentences of different languages since timing is correlated to the same audio (Itamar and Itai, 2008) ."}, {"id": 10, "string": "In the presence of multiple aligned audio for the same movie, the alignment can be extended to obtain parallel speech corpora."}, {"id": 11, "string": "Popular movies, TV shows and documentaries are released with dubbed audio in many countries."}, {"id": 12, "string": "Dubbing requires the voice acting of the original speech in another language."}, {"id": 13, "string": "Because of this, the dubbed speech carries more or less the same paralinguistic aspects of the original speech."}, {"id": 14, "string": "In what follows, we describe our methodology for the extraction of a speech parallel corpus based on any language pair from dubbed movies."}, {"id": 15, "string": "Unlike Tsiartas et al."}, {"id": 16, "string": "(2011) , who propose a method based on machine learning for automatically extracting bilingual audio-subtitle pairs from movies, we only need raw movie data, and do not require any training."}, {"id": 17, "string": "Moreover, our methodology ensures the fulfilment of the following requirements: (a) it is easily expandable, (b) it supports multiple pairs of languages, (c) it can handle any domain and speech style, and (d) it delivers a parallel spoken language corpus with annotated expressive speech."}, {"id": 18, "string": "\"Expressive speech\" annotation means that the corpus is prosodically rich, which is essential to be able to deal with non-neutral speech emotions, as done in increasingly popular speech-to-speech translation applications that try to cope with prosody transfer between source and target utterances (Ag\u00fcero et al., 2006; Sridhar et al., 2008; Anumanchipalli et al., 2012) ."}, {"id": 19, "string": "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows."}, {"id": 20, "string": "Section 2 reviews the main multilingual parallel speech corpora

so far."}, {"id": 22, "string": "In Section 5, finally, some conclusions are drawn and some aspects of our future work in the context of parallel speech corpora are mentioned."}, {"id": 23, "string": "Available Parallel Speech Corpora As already mentioned above, several attempts have been made to compile large spoken parallel corpora."}, {"id": 24, "string": "Such corpora of considerable size are,

{"id": 25, "string": "All of them have been manually compiled, and all of them show one or several shortcomings."}, {"id": 26, "string": "The EPIC corpus, which has been compiled from speeches from the European Parliament and their interpretations, falls short in reflecting the prosodic aspects in the interpreted speech."}, {"id": 27, "string": "The EMIME database is a compilation of prompted speeches and does not capture the natural spoken language traits."}, {"id": 28, "string": "The MSLT corpus has been collected in bilingual conversation settings, but there is no one-to-one alignment between sentences in different languages."}, {"id": 29, "string": "A summary of the available bilingual speech corpora is listed in Table 1 ."}, {"id": 30, "string": "Methodology Our multimodal parallel corpus creation consists of three main stages: (1) movie sentence segmentation, (2) prosodic parameter extraction, and (3) parallel sentence alignment."}, {"id": 31, "string": "The first and second stages can be seen as a monolingual data creation, as they take the audio and subtitle pairs as input in one language, and output speech/text/prosodic parameters at the sentence level."},

the SubRip text file format 1 (SRT) is accepted."}, {"id": 37, "string": "Each subtitle entry contains the following information: (i) start time, (ii) end time, and (iii) text of the speech spoken at that time in the movie."}, {"id": 38, "string": "The subtitle entries do not necessarily correspond to sentences: a subtitle entry may include more than one sentence, and a sentence can spread over many subtitle entries; consider an example portion of a subtitle: The sentence segmentation stage starts with a preprocessing step in which elements that do not correspond to speech are removed."},

end."}, {"id": 45, "string": "Then, each audio segment and its respective subtitle text are sent to the speech aligner software (Vocapia Scribe 2 ) to detect word boundaries."}, {"id": 46, "string":

"string": "If the confidence score is above a threshold of 0.5, the initial segment is cut from occurrences of sentence-endings."}, {"id": 52, "string": "In a second pass, cut segments that do not end with a sentenceending punctuation mark are merged with the subsequent segments to form full sentences."}, {"id": 53, "string": "We used Libav 3 library to perform the audio cuts."}, {"id": 54,
