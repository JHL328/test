Spelling Check 1 Introduction Chinese spelling checkers are relatively difficult to develop, partly because no word delimiters exist among Chinese words and a Chinese word can contain only a single character or multiple characters."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Furthermore, there are more than 13 thousand Chinese characters, instead of only 26 letters in English, and each with its own context to constitute a meaningful Chinese word."}, {"id": 2, "string": "All these make Chinese spell checking a challengeable task."}, {"id": 3, "string": "An empirical analysis indicated that Chinese spelling errors frequently arise from confusion among multiple-character words, which are phonologically and visually similar, but semantically distinct (Liu et al., 2011) ."}, {"id": 4, "string": "The automatic spelling checker should have both capabilities of identifying the spelling errors and suggesting the correct characters of erroneous usages."}, {"id": 5, "string": "The SIGHAN 2013 Bake-off for Chinese Spelling Check was the first campaign to provide data sets as benchmarks for the performance evaluation of Chinese spelling checkers (Wu et al., 2013) ."}, {"id": 6, "string": "The data in SIGHAN 2013 originated from the essays written by native Chinese speakers."}, {"id": 7, "string": "Following the experience of the first evaluation, the second bake-off was held in CIPS-SIGHAN Joint CLP-2014 conference, which focuses on the essays written by learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) (Yu et al., 2014) ."}, {"id": 8, "string": "Due to the greater challenge in detecting and correcting spelling errors in CFL leaners' written essays, SIGHAN 2015 Bake-off, again features a Chinese Spelling Check task, providing an evaluation platform for the development and implementation of automatic Chinese spelling checkers."}, {"id": 9, "string": "Given a passage composed of several sentences, the checker is expected to identify all possible spelling errors, highlight their locations, and suggest possible corrections."}, {"id": 10, "string": "The rest of this article is organized as follows."}, {"id": 11, "string": "Section 2 provides an overview of the SIGHAN 2015

of incorrect character and its correct version."}, {"id": 24, "string": "Examples are given as follows."}, {"id": 25, "string": "There are 2 wrong characters in Ex."}, {"id": 26, "string": "1, and correct characters \"\u5e0c,\" and \"\u671b\" should be used in locations 4, and 5, respectively."}, {"id": 27, "string": "In Ex."}, {"id": 28, "string": "2, the 17 th character \"\u504f\" is wrong, and should be \"\u904d\"."}, {"id": 29, "string": "Location \"0\" denotes that there is no spelling error in Ex."}, {"id": 30, "string": "3 Data Preparation The learner corpus used in our task was collected from the essay section of the computer-based Test of Chinese as a Foreign Language (TOCFL), administered in Taiwan."}, {"id": 31, "string": "The spelling errors were manually annotated by trained native Chinese speakers, who also provided corrections corresponding to each error."}, {"id": 32, "string": "The essays were then split into three sets as follows (1) Training Set: this set

Set: a total of 39 passages were given to participants to familiarize themselves with the final testing process."}, {"id": 39, "string": "Each participant can submit several runs generated using

fine-tune their developed models in the dryrun phase."}, {"id": 41, "string": "The purpose of dryrun is to validate the submitted output format only, and no dryrun outcomes were considered in the official evaluation (3) Test Set: this set consists of 1,100 testing passages."}, {"id": 42, "string": "Half of these passages contained no spelling errors, while the other half included at least one spelling error."}, {"id": 43, "string": "The evaluation was con- ducted as an open test."}, {"id": 44, "string": "In addition to the data sets provided, registered participant teams were allowed to employ any linguistic and computational resources to detect and correct spelling errors."}, {"id": 45, "string": "Besides, passages written by CFL learners may yield grammatical errors, missing or
