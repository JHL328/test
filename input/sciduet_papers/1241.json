{"title": "Personalized Machine Translation: Preserving Original Author Traits", "abstract": "The language that we produce reflects our personality, and various personal and demographic characteristics can be detected in natural language texts. We focus on one particular personal trait of the author, gender, and study how it is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that author's gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals texts, but this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple domainadaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the translation, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation systems.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Among many factors that mold the makeup of a text, gender and other authorial traits play a major role in our perception of

during the translation process."}, {"id": 5, "string": "It is generally agreed that good translation goes beyond transformation of the original content, by preserving more subtle and implicit characteristics inferred by author's personality, as well as era, geography, and various cultural and sociological aspects."}, {"id": 6, "string": "In this work we explore whether translations preserve the stylistic characteristic of the author and, furthermore, whether the prominent signals of the source are retained in the target language."}, {"id": 7, "string": "As a first step, we focus on gender as a demographic trait (partially due to the absence of parallel data annotated for other traits)."}, {"id": 8, "string": "We evaluate the accuracy of automatic gender classification on original texts, on their manual translations and on their automatic translations generated through statistical machine translation (SMT)."}, {"id": 9, "string": "We show that while gender has a strong signal in originals, this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation."}, {"id": 10, "string": "Surprisingly, determining gender over manual translation is even harder than over SMT; this may be an artifact of the translation process itself or the human translators involved in it."}, {"id": 11, "string": "were the first to show that authorial gender signals tend to vanish through both

methodology based on the finding that the translation process itself has a stronger signal than the author's gender ( \u00a74.1)."}, {"id": 15, "string": "We then move on to assessing gender traits in SMT ( \u00a75)."}, {"id": 16, "string": "Since SMT systems typically do not take personality or demographic information into account, we hypothesize that the author's style, affected by their personality, will fade."}, {"id": 17, "string": "Furthermore, we propose simple domain-adaptation techniques that do consider gender information and can therefore better retain the original traits."}, {"id": 18, "string": "We build \"gender-aware\" SMT systems, and show ( \u00a76) that they retain gender markers while preserving general translation quality."}, {"id": 19, "string": "Our findings

prominent features that reflect gender in originals and translations ( \u00a77)."}, {"id": 21, "string": "Our experiments reveal that gender markers differ greatly by language, and the specific source language has a significant impact on the features and classification accuracy of the translated text."}, {"id": 22, "string": "In particular, gender traits of the original language overshadow those of the target language in both manual and automatic translation products."}, {"id": 23, "string": "The main contributions of this paper are thus: (i) a new parallel corpus annotated with gender and age

gender traits while maintaining translation quality."}, {"id": 24, "string": "Related work While modeling of demographic traits has been proven beneficial in some NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis

work."}, {"id": 26, "string": "Machine translation (MT) Virtually no previous work in MT takes into account personal traits."}, {"id": 27, "string": "State-of-the-art MT systems are built from examples of translations, where the general assumption is that the more data available to train models, the better, and a single model is usually produced."}, {"id": 28, "string": "Exceptions to this assumption revolve around work on domain adaption, where systems are customized by using data that comes from a particular text domain (Hasler et al., 2014; Cuong and Sima'an, 2015) ; and work on data cleaning, where spurious data is removed from the training set to ensure the quality of the final models (Cui et al., 2013; Simard, 2014) ."}, {"id": 29, "string": "Personal traits, sometimes well marked in the translation examples, are therefore not explicitly addressed."}, {"id": 30, "string": "Learning from different, sometimes conflicting writing styles can hinder model performance and lead to translations that are unfaithful to the source text."}, {"id": 31, "string": "Focusing on reader preferences, Mirkin and Meunier (2015) used a collaborative filtering approach from recommender systems, where a user's preferred translation is predicted based on the preferences of similar users."}, {"id": 32, "string": "However, the user preferences in this case refer to the overall choice
