{"title": "Encoding of phonology in a recurrent neural model of grounded speech", "abstract": "We study the representation and encoding of phonemes in a recurrent neural network model of grounded speech. We use a model which processes images and their spoken descriptions, and projects the visual and auditory representations into the same semantic space. We perform a number of analyses on how information about individual phonemes is encoded in the MFCC features extracted from the speech signal, and the activations of the layers of the model. Via experiments with phoneme decoding and phoneme discrimination we show that phoneme representations are most salient in the lower layers of the model, where low-level signals are processed at a fine-grained level, although a large amount of phonological information is retain at the top recurrent layer. We further find out that the attention mechanism following the top recurrent layer significantly attenuates encoding of phonology and makes the utterance embeddings much more invariant to synonymy. Moreover, a hierarchical clustering of phoneme representations learned by the network shows an organizational structure of phonemes similar to those proposed in linguistics.", "text": [{"id": 0,

182, "string": "Across all the recurrent layers the error rate is small, showing that some form of phonological information is present throughout this part of the model."}, {"id": 183, "string":

used for decoding, the algorithm used for clustering, or the similarity metric for representational similarity analysis."}, {"id": 187, "string": "To the extent that more than one experiment points to the same conclusion our confidence in the reliability of the insights gained will be increased."}, {"id": 188, "string": "Earlier work (Chrupa\u0142a et al., 2017a) shows that encoding of semantics in our RNN model of grounded speech becomes stronger in higher layers, while encoding of form becomes weaker."}, {"id": 189, "string": "The main high-level results of our study confirm this pattern by showing that the representation of phonological knowledge is most accurate in the lower layers of the model."}, {"id": 190, "string": "This general pattern is to be expected as the objective of the utterance encoder is to transform the input acoustic features in such a way that it can be matched to its counterpart in a completely separate modality."}, {"id": 191, "string": "Many of the details of how this happens, however, are far from obvious: perhaps most surprisingly we found that a large amount of phonological information is still available up to the top recurrent layer."}, {"id": 192, "string": "Evidence for this pattern emerges from the phoneme decoding task, the ABX task and the synonym discrimination task."}, {"id": 193, "string": "The last one also shows that the attention layer filters out and significantly attenuates encoding of phonology and makes the utterance embeddings much more invariant to synonymy."}, {"id": 194, "string": "Our model is trained on synthetic speech, which is easier to process than natural human-generated speech."}, {"id": 195, "string": "While small-scale databases of natural speech and image are available (e.g."}, {"id": 196, "string":

and apply our methodology to grounded human speech and investigate whether context and speaker-invariant phoneme representations can be learned from natural, noisy input."}, {"id": 198, "string": "We
