{"title": "A Framework for Representing Language Acquisition in a Population Setting", "abstract": "Language variation and change are driven both by individuals' internal cognitive processes and by the social structures through which language propagates. A wide range of computational frameworks have been proposed to connect these drivers. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and propose a new analytic framework which combines previous network models' ability to capture realistic social structure with practically and more elegant computational properties. The framework privileges the process of language acquisition and embeds learners in a social network but is modular so that population structure can be combined with different acquisition models. We demonstrate two applications for the framework: a test of practical concerns that arise when modeling acquisition in a population setting and an application of the framework to recent work on phonological mergers in progress.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction The process of language change should be thought of as a two-step cycle in which 1) individuals acquire their native languages from their predecessors then 2) pass them on to their successors."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Small changes accrue over time this way and create both small-scale interpersonal variation and large-scale typological differences."}, {"id": 2, "string": "It is easy to draw a strong analogy here between linguistic evolution and biological evolution."}, {"id": 3, "string": "Both feature classic descent with modification, except while phenotypes are transmitted through genes and acted on by natural selection, language is both transmitted through and constrained by the individual (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981;

+ and g \u2212 , and learners internalize one or the other according to the 17% threshold of M + in their input."}, {"id": 173, "string": "One cluster represents the source of the merger and is initialized at 100% g + , while the rest begin 100% g \u2212 ."}, {"id": 174, "string": "Inter-cluster connections are chosen randomly so that some connections are between central members of the clusters and some are between peripheral members."}, {"id": 175, "string": "The one merged cluster is connected to half the other clusters representing those at the frontier of the change, and each other cluster is connected to five randomly chosen ones."}, {"id": 176, "string": "4 This network structure echoes work in sociolinguistics, in particular, Milroy and Milroy (1985) 's notion of strong and weak connections in language change, where weak connections between social clusters are particularly important for propagation of a change."}, {"id": 177, "string": "Propagation of the merged grammar is calculated by E n because we are interested in the behavior of individuals without loss of precision and because it cannot be assumed that each cluster is internally uniform."}, {"id": 178, "string": "5 Since the spread of the merger has been rapid enough to detect over a period of a few years, iterations are modeled as short age co-horts rather than full generations in the first experiments by updating only a randomly chosen 10% of nodes at each iteration because only a fraction of the population is learning at any given time."}, {"id": 179, "string": "A model where every node is updated is investigated as well."}, {"id": 180, "string": "Results The behavior of this simulation is shown graphically in Figure 4 ."}, {"id": 181, "string": "The fine/colored lines indicate

cluster in succession over the \"weak\" inter-cluster connections and through each cluster over the 'strong' connections before moving on to the next ones."}, {"id": 183, "string": "Everett, 1995) members have the merger, a period of rapid diffusion of the merger, then some time where a few laggards resist the merger."}, {"id": 184, "string": "As a result, most clusters exhibit an S-like shape."}, {"id": 185, "string": "A few clusters change rapidly because of their especially wellconnected positions in the network, and some lag behind the rest because they are poorly connected to the rest of the network."}, {"id": 186, "string": "More interestingly, the population-wide average, the population-level data at the kind of granularity that is often studied, yields a smooth S-curve with a shallower slope than the individual clusters."}, {"id": 187, "string": "The fact that it arises naturally here in a network that conforms with typical network shapes but was otherwise randomly generated is encouraging because the experiment was not set up so that it would produce such a curve, and the steep rate of change in individual clusters is what is expected for a change that is rapid enough to affect siblings differently."}, {"id": 188, "string": "In the above simulation, only a fraction of nodes were updated at each iteration in order to model a rapid change."}, {"id": 189, "string": "In order to confirm that this choice is not affecting the results and to test a purer implementation of the framework presented here, we remove that constraint and update every node at each iteration."}, {"id": 190, "string": "Figure 5 shows what happens over 20 iterations in a network that is otherwise identical but with 2/5 as many inter-cluster connections as the original."}, {"id": 191, "string": "A qualitatively similar pattern arises, so the choice to update only a fraction of the population is not crucially affecting the results."}, {"id": 192, "string": "In all experiments so far, social connections were fixed at the first iteration even though connections in real populations tend to change over time."}, {"id": 193, "string": "To investigate that modeling assumption, we perform another simulation in which connections are randomly updated both within and across clusters at each iteration akin to Kauhanen (2016) 's rewiring."}, {"id": 194, "string": "The result as shown in Figure 6 is similar to before, with one major difference."}, {"id": 195, "string": "The individual clusters transition more closely in time because no individual cluster remains poorly connected or especially well connected throughout the entire simulation."}, {"id": 196, "string": "Finally, we test our assumptions about population size by repeating the experiments on a smaller network of 40 clusters of 18 individuals."}, {"id": 197, "string": "The results are qualitatively similar, but the S-curve appears to be more sensitive to probabilistic connections in the network."}, {"id": 198, "string": "To explore this, we present the average network-wide rate of (M + ) across 10 trials, revealing that an S-like curve is formed each time but that its slope varies."}, {"id": 199, "string": "A few trials never reach 100% because some of the clusters are not connected to the innovative one."}, {"id": 200, "string": "The slope varies between trials, indicating that the rate of change is a function of both the population structure and the learning algorithm, but the network size does not substantially affect these results."}, {"id": 201, "string": "Discussion The algebraic-network framework for modeling population-level language change presented here has substantial practical and theoretical advantages over previous ones."}, {"id": 202, "string": "It is much simpler computationally than previous frameworks because it calculates the statistically expected behavior of each generation analytically and therefore removes the entire inner loop of calculating stochastic inter-agent interactions from the simulation."}, {"id": 203, "string": "It follows the Niyogi and Berwick (1996) formalism for language change which presents a clean and modular way of reasoning about the problem and promotes the centrality of language acquisition."}, {"id": 204, "string": "In addition to the core algorithm, the framework offers enough flexibility to represent a wide variety of processes from the highly abstract (e.g., Kauhanen (2016) ) to those grounded in soci-olinguistic and acquisition research (e.g., Yang (2009) )."}, {"id": 205, "string": "In our investigation of Kauhanen's basic assumptions, we discover how seemingly innocuous decisions about population size and learning conspire to drive simulation results."}, {"id": 206, "string": "If learners are conceived as categorical learners, population size becomes a deciding factor in the path of change."}, {"id": 207, "string": "So while the original results are interesting and meaningful, they may only valid for small (on the order of 10 2 ) populations."}, {"id": 208, "string": "In our simulation of the spread of the COT-CAUGHT merger, we show how a cognitivelymotivated model of acquisition requires a network model in order to represent population-level language change."}, {"id": 209, "string": "The population is represented as a collection of individual clusters based on sociological work, but the clusters themselves are connected randomly."}, {"id": 210, "string": "The fact that S-curves arise naturally from these networks underscores their centrality to language change."}, {"id": 211, "string": "One problem that this line of simulation work has always faced has been the lack of viable comparison between models because every study implements its own learning, network, and interaction models."}, {"id": 212, "string": "The modular nature of our framework advances against this trend since it is now possible to hold the population model constant while slotting in various learning models to test them against one another and vice-versa."}, {"id": 213, "string": "Finally, since this framework reduces to Niyogi & Berwick's models in perfectly-mixed populations, it can be used to reason about the formal dynamics of language change as well."}, {"id": 214, "string": "Without simulation, it would be difficult or impossible to undercover the interplay between acquisition and social structure on the propagation of language change."}, {"id": 215, "string": "Neither factor alone can account for the theoretical or empirically observed patterns."}, {"id": 216,
