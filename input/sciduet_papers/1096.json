{"title": "The Language of Legal and Illegal Activity on the Darknet", "abstract": "The non-indexed parts of the Internet (the Darknet) have become a haven for both legal and illegal anonymous activity. Given the magnitude of these networks, scalably monitoring their activity necessarily relies on automated tools, and notably on NLP tools. However, little is known about what characteristics texts communicated through the Darknet have, and how well off-the-shelf NLP tools do on this domain. This paper tackles this gap and performs an in-depth investigation of the characteristics of legal and illegal text in the Darknet, comparing it to a clear net website with similar content as a control condition. Taking drug-related websites as a test case, we find that texts for selling legal and illegal drugs have several linguistic characteristics that distinguish them from one another, as well as from the control condition, among them the distribution of POS tags, and the coverage of their named entities in Wikipedia. 1", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction The term \"Darknet\" refers to the

includes many slang terms for illicit drugs and paraphernalia."}, {"id": 101, "string": "These slang terms are usually not well known by the general public, and are therefore less likely to be covered by Wikipedia and similar public databases."}, {"id": 102, "string": "In addition to the differences in Wikification ratios between the domains, it seems spaCy had trouble correctly identifying named entities in both Onion and eBay sites, possibly due to the common use of informal language and drugrelated jargon."}, {"id": 103, "string": "Eyeballing the results, there were a fair number of false positives (words and phrases that were found by spaCy but were not actually named entities), especially in Illegal Onion sites."}, {"id": 104, "string": "In particular, slang terms for drugs, as well as abbreviated drug terms, for example \"kush\" or \"GBL\", were being falsely picked up by spaCy."}, {"id": 105, "string": "6 To summarize, results suggest both that (1) legal and illegal texts are
