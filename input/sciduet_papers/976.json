{"title": "How do you pronounce your name? Improving G2P with transliterations", "abstract": "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P) of names is an important and challenging problem. The correct pronunciation of a name is often reflected in its transliterations, which are expressed within a different phonological inventory. We investigate the problem of using transliterations to correct errors produced by state-of-the-art G2P systems. We present a novel re-ranking approach that incorporates a variety of score and n-gram features, in order to leverage transliterations from multiple languages. Our experiments demonstrate significant accuracy improvements when re-ranking is applied to n-best lists generated by three different G2P programs.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction

designed to handle n-best output lists."}, {"id": 199, "string": "Although our approach is (to the best of our knowledge) the first to use different tasks (G2P and transliteration) to inform each other, this is conceptually similar to model and system combination approaches."}, {"id": 200, "string": "In statistical machine translation (SMT), methods that incorporate translations from other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) have proven effective in low-resource situations: when phrase translations are unavailable for a certain language, one can look at other languages where the

"Notably, the focus of these works have been on cases in which there are less data available; they also modify the generation process directly, rather than operating on existing outputs as we do."},

(Hindi), necessitating the use of smarter methods that can incorporate multiple transliteration languages."}, {"id": 211, "string": "We apply SVM reranking to this task, enabling us to use a variety

essential to provide the re-ranking system with transliterations from multiple languages in order to mitigate the differences between phonological inventories and smooth out noise in the transliterations."}, {"id": 215, "string": "In the future, we plan to generalize our approach so that it can be applied to the task of generating transliterations, and to combine data from distinct G2P dictionaries."}, {"id": 216, "string": "The latter task is related to the notion of domain adaptation."}, {"id": 217, "string": "We would also like to apply our approach to web data; we have shown that it is possible to use noisy transliteration data, so it may be possible to leverage the noisy ad hoc pronunciation data as well."}, {"id": 218, "string": "Finally, we plan to investigate earlier integration of such external information into the G2P process for single systems; while we noted that re-ranking provides a general approach applicable to any system that can generate n-best lists, there is a limit as to what re-ranking can do, as it relies on the correct output existing in the n-best list."}, {"id": 219, "string": "Modifying existing systems would provide greater potential for
