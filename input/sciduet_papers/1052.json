{"title": "Post Retraction Citations in Context", "abstract": "In this paper we explore post retraction citations to retracted papers. The reasons for retractions in our sample were data manipulation, small sample size, scientific misconduct, and duplicate publication by the authors. We found, that the huge majority of the citations are positive, and the citing papers usually fail to mention that the cited article was retracted. Retracted articles are freely available at the publishers' site, which is probably a catalyst for receiving more citations.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Studies on retracted articles show that the amount of retracted articles has increased in relative measure to the overall increase in scientific publications [1, 2] ."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Although retracting articles helps purge the scientific literature of erroneous or unethical research, citations to such research present a real challenge."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Citing articles that were retracted especially due to plagiarism, data falsification or any other unethical practices interferes with the process of eliminating such studies form the literature and research."}, {"id": 3, "string": "There are two types of retraction citations; citations that a retracted article received prior to its retraction and citations that are received post retraction and despite retraction notices [3, 4] ."}, {"id": 4, "string": "Both types of citations put the scientific process in jeopardy, especially when they are cited as legitimate references to previous work."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Some studies on retracted articles have shown that retracted articles that received a high number of citations preretraction are more likely to occur additional citations post-retraction [4, 5] ."}, {"id": 6, "string": "A good example is described in a study by [6] who studied the case of Scott S. Reuben who was convicted of fabricating data in 25 of his studies which resulted in mass retractions of his articles."}, {"id": 7, "string": "The authors of the study have shown that the popularity of Reuben's articles did not diminish post-retraction even 5 years after the retractions have been made."}, {"id": 8, "string": "Another phenomenon that was identified in the literature is of authors' selfciting their retracted articles and thus contributing to the perception that their retracted work is valid [7] ."}, {"id": 9, "string": "In this study we sought out to find the context around post-retraction citations with the main purpose of finding out whether they are negatively, positively or neutrally mentioned."}, {"id": 10, "string": "In this case study we present a sample of five

accusation of fraud and fabrication of results, the editors found no such evidence to that effect."}, {"id": 43, "string": "However, the article was retracted because of the \"low number of animals\" used in this study which lead to the conclusion that \"no definitive conclusions can be reached with this small sample size\"."}, {"id": 44, "string": "This article was cited 109 times since its

methodologists' findings of irregularities in the reported data and falsification of results, and the authors' lack of proper response to their findings, the article was retracted from the journal."},

(2015-March 2016 -24 citations of which 23 were analyzed) shows that all citations were positive citations, meaning that the citing authors used findings from this article to support their findings."}, {"id": 65, "string": "The subject of \"authentic leadership\" is popular in management studies and has seen a surge in publications since 2012."}, {"id": 66, "string": "This could explain

the text, but in the references it appears as retracted."}, {"id": 73, "string": "4 Discussion and Conclusions As can be seen from the examples above, retracted articles continue to be cited years after retraction and despite retraction notices being posted on publishers' platforms."}, {"id": 74, "string": "In some cases, the continuous citations rates could be the result of general interest by the public or media."}, {"id": 75, "string": "For example, the S\u00e9ralini article evoked an ongoing public debate regarding the safety of GM foods which resulted in a call to label all such food."}, {"id": 76, "string": "This could explain the continuing interest in the study and its citations."}, {"id": 77, "string": "The article was also republished and thus continues to be cited despite of the fact that the authors did not modify it."}, {"id": 78, "string": "In the case of the Mukherjee article, again, public interest could explain its continuing citations."}, {"id": 79, "string": "Resveratrol was hailed by the media as an important supplement that could ensure longevity and good health and is an off the counter supplement available in vitamin shops."}, {"id": 80, "string": "Finally, the Walumbwa article which describes 'authentic leadership' and followers' dynamic is also a topic of media and business management interest."}, {"id": 81, "string": "With numerous management books published on this topic it has been accepted as a management style encouraged by corporations."}, {"id": 82, "string": "In other cases, the reason for retraction does not deter others from citing the article."}, {"id": 83, "string": "For example, the Donmez article (case study 1 above) was retracted because of poor graphing and data representation."}, {"id": 84, "string": "However, the editors do state in the retraction notice that these faults do not apply to the results of the study, even though on PubPeer [14] there was an extensive discussion on problems with the article."}, {"id": 85, "string": "The editors' approval of the results could be the reason for the continuing citations to the article."}, {"id": 86, "string": "The Li article, as another example, re-used data and thus violated the originality rule of scientific publishing."}, {"id": 87, "string": "However, the data itself was not refuted by the editors and the article that was published first seems to be inaccessible."}, {"id": 88, "string": "Regardless of the reasons speculated for the post-retractions citations, the fact that invalid and falsified research is continuing to appear as valid research is concerning."}, {"id": 89, "string": "We recommend that publishers use reference checks to all submitted articles to detect citations of retracted articles and remove them or at least request an explanation from the authors for citing a retracted paper in a positive or neutral manner."}, {"id": 90, "string": "This explanation should clearly appear in the paper."}, {"id": 91, "string": "In addition, we would recommend the deletion of retracted articles from publishers' websites."}, {"id": 92, "string": "Currently, at least for the major publishers: Elsevier, Springer Nature and Wiley, but possibly a general practice, retracted articles are not only available on the publishers' site, but they are freely available, without the need for a subscription or for a one-time payment."}, {"id": 93, "string": "While leaving a retraction notice, the article itself should not appear on platforms such as ScienceDirect or others."}, {"id": 94, "string": "Although versions of these articles may appear elsewhere, the journal websites should not carry these versions and make it difficult for authors to download, read and consequently cite retracted articles."}, {"id": 95, "string":
