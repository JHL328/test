{"title": "MediaMeter: A Global Monitor for Online News Coverage", "abstract": "This paper introduces MediaMeter, an application that works to detect and track emergent topics in the US online news media. What makes MediaMeter unique is its reliance on a labeling algorithm which we call WikiLabel, whose primary goal is to identify what news stories are about by looking up Wikipedia. We discuss some of the major news events that were successfully detected and how it compares to prior work.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction A long term goal of this project is to build a sociologically credible computational platform that enables the user to observe how social agenda evolve and spread across the globe and across the media, as they happen."}, {"id": 1, "string": "To this end, we have built a prototype system we call MediaMeter, which is designed to detect and track trending topics in the online US news media."}, {"id": 2, "string": "One important feature of the system lies in its making use of and building upon a particular approach called WikiLabel (Nomoto, 2011) ."}, {"id": 3, "string": "The idea was to identify topics of a document by mapping it into a conceptual space derived from Wikipedia, which consists of finding a Wikipedia page similar to the document and taking its page title as a possible topic label."}, {"id": 4, "string": "Further, to deal with events not known to Wikipedia, it is equipped with the capability of re-creating a page title so as to make it better fit the content of the document."}, {"id": 5, "string": "In the following, we look at what WikiLabel does and how it works before we discuss MediaMeter."}, {"id": 6, "string": "WikiLabel WikiLabel takes as input a document which one likes to have labeled, and outputs a ranked list of label candidates along with the confidence scores."}, {"id": 7, "string": "The document it takes as input needs to be in the form of a vector space model (VSM)."}, {"id": 8, "string": "Now assume that \u03b8 represents a VSM of document d.
