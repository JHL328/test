{"title": "Coarse-to-Fine Decoding for Neural Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Semantic parsing aims at mapping natural language utterances into structured meaning representations. In this work, we propose a structure-aware neural architecture which decomposes the semantic parsing process into two stages.
