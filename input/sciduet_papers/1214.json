{"title": "Deep Keyphrase Generation", "abstract": "Keyphrase provides highly-summative information that can be effectively used for understanding, organizing and retrieving text content. Though previous studies have provided many workable solutions for automated keyphrase extraction, they commonly divided the to-be-summarized content into multiple text chunks, then ranked and selected the most meaningful ones. These approaches could neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text, nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively overcome the above drawbacks. We name it as deep keyphrase generation since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but also can generate absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text.

perform as well as we expected."}, {"id": 177, "string": "It might be because the RNN model is only concerned with finding the hidden semantics behind the text, which may tend to generate keyphrases or words that are too general and may not necessarily refer to the source text."}, {"id": 178, "string": "In addition, we observe that 2.5% (70,891/2,780,316) of keyphrases in our dataset contain out-of-vocabulary words, which the RNN model is not able to recall, since the RNN model can only generate results with the 50,000 words in vocabulary."}, {"id": 179, "string": "This indicates that a pure generative model may not fit the extraction task, and we need to further link back to the language usage within the source text."}, {"id": 180, "string": "The CopyRNN model, by considering more contextual information, significantly outperforms not only the RNN model but also all baselines, exceeding the best baselines by more than 20% on average."}, {"id": 181, "string": "This result demonstrates the importance of source text to the extraction task."}, {"id": 182, "string": "Besides, nearly 2% of all correct predictions contained outof-vocabulary words."}, {"id": 183, "string": "The example in Figure 1(a) shows the result of predicted present keyphrases by RNN and Copy-RNN for an article about video search."}, {"id": 184, "string": "We see that both models can generate phrases that relate to the topic of information retrieval and video."}, {"id": 185, "string": "However most of RNN predictions are high-level terminologies, which are too general to be selected as keyphrases."}, {"id": 186, "string": "CopyRNN, on the other hand, predicts more detailed phrases like \"video metadata\" and \"integrated ranking\"."}, {"id": 187, "string": "An interesting bad case, \"rich content\" coordinates with a keyphrase \"video metadata\", and the CopyRNN mistakenly puts it into prediction."}, {"id": 188, "string": "Predicting Absent Keyphrases As stated, one important motivation for this work is that we are interested in the proposed model's capability for predicting absent keyphrases based on the \"understanding\" of content."}, {"id": 189, "string": "It is worth noting that such prediction is a very challenging task, and, to the best of our knowledge, no existing methods can handle this task."}, {"id": 190, "string": "Therefore, we only provide the RNN and CopyRNN performances in the discussion of the results of this task."}, {"id": 191, "string": "Here, we evaluate the performance within the recall of the top 10 and top 50 results, to see how many absent keyphrases can be correctly predicted."}, {"id": 192, "string": "We use the absent keyphrases in the testing datasets for evaluation."}, {"id": 193, "string": "Table 3 presents the recall results of the top 10/50 predicted keyphrases for our RNN and CopyRNN models, in which we observe that the CopyRNN can, on average, recall around 8% (15%) of keyphrases at top 10 (50) predictions."}, {"id": 194, "string": "This indicates that, to some extent, both models can capture the hidden semantics behind the textual content and make reasonable predictions."}, {"id": 195, "string": "In addition, with the advantage of features from the source text, the CopyRNN model also outperforms the RNN model in this condition, though it does not show as much improvement as the present keyphrase extraction task."}, {"id": 196, "string": "An example is shown in Figure 1(b) , in which we see that two absent keyphrases, \"video retrieval\" and \"video indexing\", are correctly recalled by both models."}, {"id": 197, "string": "Note that the term \"indexing\" does not appear in the text, but the models may detect the information \"index videos\" in the first sentence and paraphrase it to the target phrase."}, {"id": 198, "string": "And the CopyRNN successfully predicts another two keyphrases by capturing the detailed information from the text (highlighted text segments)."}, {"id": 199, "string": "Transferring the Model to the News Domain RNN and CopyRNN are supervised models, and they are trained on data in a specific domain and writing style."}, {"id": 200, "string": "However, with sufficient training on a large-scale dataset, we expect the models to be able to learn universal language features that are also effective in other corpora."}, {"id": 201, "string": "Thus in this task, we will test our model on another type of text, to see whether the model would work when being transferred to a different environment."}, {"id": 202, "string": "We use the popular news article dataset DUC-2001 (Wan and Xiao, 2008) for analysis."}, {"id": 203, "string": "The dataset consists of 308 news articles and 2,488 manually annotated keyphrases."}, {"id": 204, "string": "The result of this analysis is shown in Table 4 , from which we could see that the CopyRNN can extract a portion of correct keyphrases from a unfamiliar text."}, {"id": 205, "string": "Compared to the results reported in (Hasan and Ng, 2010) , the performance of CopyRNN is better than Tex-tRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and KeyCluster (Liu et al., 2009) , but lags behind the other three baselines."}, {"id": 206, "string": "As it is transferred to a corpus in a completely different type and domain, the model encounters more unknown words and has to rely more on the positional and syntactic features within the text."}, {"id": 207, "string": "In this experiment, the CopyRNN recalls 766 keyphrases."}, {"id": 208, "string": "14.3% of them contain out-ofvocabulary words, and many names of persons and places are correctly predicted."}, {"id": 209, "string": "Discussion Our experimental results demonstrate that the CopyRNN model not only performs well on predicting present keyphrases, but also has the ability to generate topically relevant keyphrases that are absent in the text."}, {"id": 210, "string": "In a broader sense, this model attempts to map a long text (i.e., paper abstract) with representative short text chunks (i.e., keyphrases), which can potentially be applied to improve information retrieval performance by generating high-quality index terms, as well as assisting user browsing by summarizing long documents into short, readable phrases."}, {"id": 211, "string": "Thus far, we have tested our model with scientific publications and news articles, and have demonstrated that our model has the ability to capture universal language patterns and extract key information from unfamiliar texts."}, {"id": 212, "string": "We believe that our model has a greater potential to be generalized to other domains and types, like books, online reviews, etc., if it is trained on a larger data corpus."}, {"id": 213, "string": "Also, we directly applied our model, which was trained on a publication dataset, into generating keyphrases for news articles without any adaptive training."}, {"id": 214, "string": "We believe that with proper training on news data, the model would make further improvement."}, {"id": 215, "string": "Additionally, this work mainly studies the problem of discovering core content from textual materials."}, {"id": 216, "string": "Here, the encoder-decoder framework is applied to model language; however, such a framework can also be extended to locate the core information on other data resources, such as summarizing content from images and videos."}, {"id": 217, "string": "Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we proposed an RNN-based generative model for predicting keyphrases in scientific text."}, {"id": 218, "string": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the encoder-decoder model to a keyphrase prediction task."}, {"id": 219, "string": "Our model summarizes phrases based the deep semantic meaning of the text, and is able to handle rarely-occurred phrases by incorporating a copying mechanism."}, {"id": 220, "string": "Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model for generating both present and absent keyphrases for different types of text."}, {"id": 221, "string": "Our future work may include the following two directions."}, {"id": 222, "string": "-In this work, we only evaluated the performance of the proposed model by conducting off-line experiments."}, {"id": 223, "string": "In the future, we are interested in comparing the model to human annotators and using human judges to evaluate the quality of predicted phrases."}, {"id": 224, "string": "-Our current model does not fully consider correlation among target keyphrases."},
