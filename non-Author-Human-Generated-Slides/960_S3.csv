0,Semantic Similarity Task,0,"semantic similarity: relating short texts or sentences in a semantic space
semantic similarity task: requires systems to determine the degree of equivalence between the underlying semantics of the two sentences",
1,Multi Relational Semantic Similarity Task,0,"A sentence pair has multiple annotations of different types of similarity
The task requires a system to determine the semantic similarity between two sentences in different dimensions",
2,Human Activity,0,"A dataset of 1,000 pairs of phrases regarding human activities
Four types of relations:
Similarity: the degree (0 to 4) to which the two phrases describe the same thing (to watch a film - to see a movie)
Relatedness: the degree (0 to 4) to which the actives are related to one another (to give a gift - to receive a present)
Motivational alignment: the degree (0 to 4) to which the activities are done with similar motivations (to eat dinner with family members - to visit relatives)
Perceived actor congruence: to degree (-2 to 2) to which the activities are expected to be done by the same type of person (to pack a suitcase -- to travel to another state)",
3,Sick,0,"4906 sentence pairs from image and video caption datasets
Two types of relations:
relatedness: ranges from 1 to 5
entailment: entailment, contradiction, neutral",
4,Typed Similarity,0,"Pilot track in the SemEval 2013 STS shared task
1471 pairs of paragraphs consisting of meta-data describing art items from Europeana (e.g., books, paintings, films)
Eight dimensions of relations: general similarity, author, people involved, time, location, event/action, subject, description",
5,Existing Model Single Task,1,A model trains and tests on one relation at a time while ignoring the rest.,
6,Proposed Multi Label Model,1,"Intuition: each relation may contain useful information about the others
Training jointly on multiple relations by outputting multiple predictions
Aggregating the losses during back-propagation",Figure 1
7,Alternative Multi Task Model,1,"Treat each relation prediction as a single task
For a batch of sentence pairs, the model only consider a type of relation at a time",
8,Comparison Between the Models,0,"Single-task: only one relations is considered and other relations are ignored  
Multi-task: only one relation is involved during each round of feed-forward and back-propagation
Multi-label: all relations are involved during each round of feed-forward and back-propagation",
9,Results,2,"Table 1
Results on the Typed-Similarity dataset
Our model outperforms the single-task settings in over half of the relations, and outperforms the multi-task
setting in all relations.

Table 2
Results on the Human Activity dataset
single-task setting achieves state-fo-the-art performance on three relations compared to previous work
multi-label setting performs better than the single-task setting
multi-task setting performs significantly worse than the other two settings

Results on the SICK dataset
Our multi-label setting outperforms the single-task baseline and the previous best result.","Table 1

10,Discussion and Conclusion,0,"We introduce a multi-label transfer learning settings for multi-relation semantic similarity tasks
Our model outperforms single-task and traditional multi-task settings in three datasets
Our framework can be applied to any dataset with multiple annotations available for each training instance",
