0,Task definition,0,We consider the specific task of language identification of names.,
1,Motivation,0,"The general task of identifying the language of text or utterances has a number of applications in natural language processing like transliteration. Language identification has traditionally been approached using character-level n-gram language models. However, the language model approach crucially depends on the length of the text in question.",
2,Previous approaches,0,"Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) applied n-grams to general text categorization and achieved 99.8% accuracy on 14 languages and text of 300 or more characters. However, this same approach drops to 90.2% accuracy on text of 17 languages of average length 50 bytes.  Konstantopoulos (2007) focuses on the task of identifying the language of proper nouns, in particular, soccer player names from 13 national languages and achieved low accuracies, on average 27% F1. Li et al. (2007) attempts a similar task on only Chinese, English, and Japanese names and achieves good results, 94.8% accuracy.",
3,Using SVMs,0,"We propose to count character n-gram occurrences in the given name, for n up to some maximum length, and use these counts as the features in an SVM. Different kernels, n-gram lengths, normalizations, and other modifications were tested until reaching optimal parameters.",Figure 1
4,Evaluation Transfermarkt corpus,0,Consists of European soccer player names from 13 languages. 14914 full names avg length 14.8 and 12051 last names avg length 7.8. SVM significantly outperforms past language models on both last names and full names. It is interesting to note that differences between kernels are statistically insignificant.,Table 1
5,Evaluation CEJ corpus,0,"Consists of Chinese, English, or Japanese first names and surnames. 97115 names of avg length 7.6 characters. SVMs outperform Li et al. language models across all 3 languages and reduces error rate by over 50%.",Table 2
6,Application to machine transliteration,0,"Machine transliteration is one of the primary potential applications of language identification because of the unique pronunciations of each language. SVMs were applied as a preprocessing step before transliteration on the English-Hindi corpus of 1000 names. In this case, language identification did not improve transliteration accuracy. This is likely due to the small training dataset size.",
7,Conclusion,0,The novel approach of SVM with n-grams as features for language identification of names outperforms past traditional methods based on language models.,
8,Future work,0,We plan to investigate other methods of incorporating language identification in machine transliteration to yield more promising results.,
