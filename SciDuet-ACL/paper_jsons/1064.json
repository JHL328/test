{"title": "A Crowd-Annotated Spanish Corpus for Humor Analysis", "abstract": "Computational Humor involves several tasks, such as humor recognition, humor generation, and humor scoring, for which it is useful to have human-curated data. In this work we present a corpus of 27,000 tweets written in Spanish and crowd-annotated by their humor value and funniness score, with about four annotations per tweet, tagged by 1,300 people over the Internet. It is equally divided between tweets coming from humorous and non-humorous accounts. The interannotator agreement Krippendorff's alpha value is 0.5710. The dataset is available for general usage and can serve as a basis for humor detection and as a first step to tackle subjectivity.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Computational Humor studies humor from a computational perspective, involving several tasks such as humor recognition, which aims to tell if a piece of text is humorous or not; humor generation, with the objective of generating new texts with funny content; and humor scoring, whose goal is to predict how funny a piece of text is."}, {"id": 1, "string": "In order to carry out this kind of tasks through supervised
