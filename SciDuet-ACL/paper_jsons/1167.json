{"title": "Evaluating text coherence based on semantic similarity graph", "abstract": "Coherence is a crucial feature of text because it is indispensable for conveying its communication purpose and meaning to its readers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised text coherence scoring based on graph construction in which edges are established between semantically similar sentences represented by vertices. The sentence similarity is calculated based on the cosine similarity of semantic vectors representing sentences. We provide three graph construction methods establishing an edge from a given vertex to a preceding adjacent vertex, to a single similar vertex, or to multiple similar vertices. We evaluated our methods in the document discrimination task and the insertion task by comparing our proposed methods to the supervised (Entity Grid) and unsupervised (Entity Graph) baselines. In the document discrimination task, our method outperformed the unsupervised baseline but could not do the supervised baseline, while in the insertion task, our method outperformed both baselines.",

task, while it ranges 0.5 \u223c 0.9 in the insertion task data."}, {"id": 203, "string": "This difference suggests that the uot factor helps relatively more in the document discrimination task for the PAV-based method, while it has less impact in the insertion task."}, {"id": 204, "string": "This explains the difference \u03b1 values of PAV across the two tasks."}, {"id": 205, "string": "To

sentence relations contributing to text coherence more appropriately than the PAV-based method."}, {"id": 224, "string": "Although the PAV-based method performs best with the present data, which considers only local cohesion between adjacent sentences, we need to introduce a more refined mechanism for incorporating distant sentence relations than the current SSV and MSV-based methods, as we

sentence in the text, and an edge represents a semantic relationship between corresponding sentences."}, {"id": 228, "string": "As cohesion is a matter of lexicosemantics, sentences are transformed into semantic vector representa-tions, and their similarity is calculated based on the cosine similarity between the vectors."}, {"id": 229, "string": "Edges between sentence vertices are established
