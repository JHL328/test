three distractors as a whole (the sum of three average ratings) are assessed to be more plausible than the distractors by its competitor."}, {"id": 169, "string": "We calculate the number of wins for each algorithm over the 50 questions in each evaluation."}, {"id": 170, "string": "We display the results of both evaluations in Table 4 and Table 5 ."}, {"id": 171, "string": "We see that the WordGap

insufficient for generating good distractors."}, {"id": 173, "string": "When a target word does not have a strong category tendency, e.g., \"venue\" and \"week\", the random news method cannot select highly plausible distractors."}, {"id": 174, "string": "In the second table, our distractor algorithm significantly betters the baseline in both number of wins (8 more) and average score (0.67

the learner's news article context."}, {"id": 179, "string": "In the larger context, we also need to check the viability of second language learning intertwined with news reading."}, {"id": 180, "string": "In a requirements survey prior to the prototype development, two-thirds of the respondents indicated that although they have interest in learning a second language, they only have only used language learning software infrequently (less than once per week) yet frequently read news, giving us motivation for our development."}, {"id": 181, "string": "Post-prototype, we conducted a summative survey to assess whether our prototype product satisfied the target niche, in terms of interest, usability and possible interference with normal reading activities."}, {"id": 182, "string": "We gathered 16 respondents, 15 of which were between the ages of 18-24."}, {"id": 183, "string": "11 (the majority) also claimed native Chinese language proficiency."}, {"id": 184, "string": "The respondents felt that the extension platform was a viable language learning platform (3.4 of 5; on a scale of 1 \"disagreement\" to 5 \"agreement\") and that they would like to try it when available for their language pair (3 of 5)."}, {"id": 185, "string": "In our original prototype, we replaced the orig-inal English word with the Chinese translation."}, {"id": 186, "string": "While most felt that replacing the original English with the Chinese translation would not hamper their reading, they still felt a bit uncomfortable (3.7 of 5)."}, {"id": 187, "string": "This finding prompted us to change the default learning tooltip behavior to underlining to hint at the tooltip presence."}, {"id": 188, "string": "Conclusion We described WordNews, a client extension and server backend that transforms the web browser into a second language learning platform."}, {"id": 189, "string": "Leveraging web-based machine translation APIs and a static dictionary, it offers a viable user-driven language learning experience by pairing an improved, context-sensitive tooltip definition service with the generation of context-sensitive multiple choice questions."}, {"id": 190, "string": "WordNews is potentially not confined to use in news websites; one respondent noted that they would like to use it on arbitrary websites, but currently we feel usable word sense disambiguation is difficult enough even in the restricted news domain."}, {"id": 191, "string": "We also note that respondents are more willing to use a mobile client for news reading, such that our future development work may be geared towards an independent mobile application, rather than a browser extension."}, {"id": 192, "string": "We also plan to conduct a longitudinal study with a cohort of second language learners to better evaluate Word-News' real-world effectiveness."}], "headers": [{"section": "Introduction", "n": "1", "start": 5, "end": 25}, {"section": "The WordNews Chrome Extension", "n": "2", "start":
