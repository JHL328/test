language models may not be compatible between different targets."}, {"id": 10, "string": "However, for some targets that can be recognized as being related to the same and more general domains, it could be possible to generalize through certain aspects of the domains that reflect users' major concerns."}, {"id": 11, "string": "For example, from the following sentence, whose stance is against the approval of a mining project, \"Environmentalists warn the $16 billion coal facility will damage the Great Barrier Reef\", it can be seen that both this sentence and the one in Table 1 mention the same aspect \"reef destruction/damage\", which is closely related to the \"environment\" domain."}, {"id": 12, "string": "In this paper, we focus on cross-target stance classification and explore the

of a stance-bearing sentence but also tend to be recurring in the corpus."}, {"id": 36, "string": "First, to capture the recurrences of the domain aspects, a simple way is to make every input sentence be consumed by this layer (see Figure 1 ), so that the layer parameters are shared across the corpus for being stimulated by all appearances of the domain aspects."}, {"id": 37, "string": "Then, we utilize self-attention to signal the core parts of a stance-bearing sentence."}, {"id": 38, "string": "Self-attention is an attention mechanism for selecting specific parts of a sequence by relating

sentence are those that are compatible with the semantics of the entire sentence."}, {"id": 40, "string": "To this end, we introduce a compatibility function to score the semantic compatibility

generalization while it does not hurt the in-target performance."}, {"id": 75, "string": "Moreover, by comparing the performance of our model under different target configurations, we see that the
