{"title": "Incorporating Satellite Documents into Co-citation Networks for Scientific Paper Searches", "abstract": "To improve the search performance of retrieval methods using cocitation linkages, this study proposes a technique to enlarge a co-citation network by incorporating satellite documents. This technique specifies satellite documents via full-text searches for terms obtained from documents having cocitation linkages with a seed document; the appropriateness of each co-citation linkage is checked by using the strength of the co-citation context based on the results of parsing documents that cite the seed document. This study evaluates search performance using the proposed technique with IR experiments. Specifically, the random walk with restart algorithm, which can compute similarities between the seed document and each document in the network, is applied to the enlarged and initial networks. Scores of the normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG@K) were then compared. The results indicate that the search performance of the retrieval methods using the enlarged network outperforms those of a baseline method using the initial network.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "INTRODUCTION In the field of scientific paper searches, citations are often used to measure implicit relationships between documents."}, {"id": 1, "string": "One approach to improve the search performance of retrieval methods using citation linkages is to enlarge the citation networks by incorporating additional information."}, {"id": 2, "string": "In the case of a network created using direct citation linkages, i.e., the linkages between the citing and cited documents, techniques to enlarge the network of citations on the basis of additional information, such as citing text [1] or user profiles [2] , have been reported."}, {"id": 3, "string": "This study enlarges the networks connected by co-citations."}, {"id": 4, "string": "A co-citation is defined as a linkage between a pair of documents concurrently cited by a third document."}, {"id": 5, "string": "In the simplest retrieval method using co-citation, documents having a cocitation relationship with a given seed document that are known to be relevant are presented to the user under the assumption that documents co-cited with such a seed document tend to be topically similar to the seed document."}, {"id": 6, "string": "Co-citation networks have been used in bibliometrics and can also be applied to scientific paper searches (e.g., [3] )."}, {"id": 7, "string": "This study proposes a technique to enlarge the co-citation network by adding word-based linkages."}, {"id": 8, "string": "When documents are detected by the co-citation linkage, it is possible to obtain more appropriate search terms from the document;
