{"title": "Detect Rumors in Microblog Posts Using Propagation Structure via Kernel Learning", "abstract": "How fake news goes viral via social media? How does its propagation pattern differ from real stories? In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-ofthe-art rumor detection models.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction On November 9th, 2016, Eric Tucker, a grassroots user who had just about 40 followers on Twitter, tweeted his unverified observations about paid protesters being bused to attend anti-Trump demonstration in Austin, Texas."}, {"id": 1, "string": "The tweet, which was proved false later, was shared over 16 thousand times on Twitter and 350 thousand times on Facebook within a couple of days, fueling a nation-wide conspiracy theory 1 ."}, {"id": 2, "string": "The diffusion of the story is illustrated as Figure 1 which gives the key spreading points of the story along the time line."}, {"id": 3, "string": "We can see that after the initial post, the tweet was shared or promoted by some influential online communities and users (including Trump himself), resulting in its wide spread."}, {"id": 4, "string": "A widely accepted definition of rumor is \"unverified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation\" (DiFonzo and Bordia, 2007) ."}, {"id": 5, "string": "This unverified information may eventually turn out to be true, or partly or entirely false."}, {"id": 6, "string": "In today's ever-connected world, rumors can arise and spread at lightening speed thanks to social media platforms, which could not only be wrong, but be misleading and dangerous to the public society."}, {"id": 7, "string": "Therefore, it is crucial to track and debunk such rumors in timely manner."}, {"id": 8, "string": "Journalists and fact-checking websites such as snopes.com have made efforts to track and detect rumors."}, {"id": 9, "string": "However, such endeavor is manual, thus prone to poor coverage and low speed."}, {"id": 10, "string": "Feature-based methods (Castillo et al., 2011;
