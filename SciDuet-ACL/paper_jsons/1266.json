This has motivated an active research line to relax this requirement, with methods that use document-aligned corpora or bilingual dictionaries of a few thousand words instead. In this work, we further reduce the need of bilingual resources using a very simple self-learning approach that can be combined with any dictionary-based mapping technique.

improvement of the latter, confirming our explanations."}, {"id": 162, "string": "Regarding random initialization, the figure shows that the algorithm gets stuck in a poor local optimum of the objective function, which is the reason of the bad performance (0% accuracy) on bilingual lexicon induction, but the proposed optimization objective itself seems to be adequate."}, {"id": 163,

8.94% for the 25 entry dictionary)."}, {"id": 167, "string": "This suggests that our algorithm tends to converge to similar solutions even for disjoint seed dictionaries, which is in line with our view that we are implicitly optimizing an objective that is independent from the seed dictionary, yet a seed dictionary is necessary to build a good enough initial solution to avoid getting stuck in poor local optima."}, {"id": 168, "string": "For that reason, it is likely that better methods to tackle this optimization problem would allow learning bilingual word embeddings without any bilingual evidence at all and, in this regard, we believe that our work opens exciting opportunities for future research."}, {"id": 169, "string": "Error analysis So as to better understand the behavior of our

this degree based solely on the distributional hypothesis, in particular when it comes to common proper names (e.g."}, {"id": 180, "string": "John, Andy), and one could design alternative strategies to address this issue like taking the edit distance as an additional signal."}, {"id": 181, "string": "For the remaining errors, all systems tend to propose translations that have some degree of relationship with the correct ones, including nearsynonyms (e.g."}, {"id": 182, "string": "guidelines \u2192 raccomandazioni), antonyms (e.g."}, {"id": 183, "string": "sender \u2192 destinatario) and words in the same semantic field (e.g."}, {"id": 184, "string": "nominalism \u2192 intuizionismo / innatismo, which are all philosophical doctrines)."}, {"id": 185, "string": "However, there are also a few instances where the relationship is weak or unclear (e.g."}, {"id": 186, "string": "loch \u2192 giardini, sweep \u2192 serrare)."}, {"id": 187, "string": "We also observe a few errors that are related to multiwords or collocations (e.g."}, {"id": 188, "string": "carrier \u2192 aereo, presumably related to the multiword air carrier / linea aerea), as well as some rare word that is repeated across many translations (Ferruzzi), which could be attributed to the hubness problem ."}, {"id": 189, "string": "All in all, our error analysis reveals that the baseline method of Artetxe et al."},
