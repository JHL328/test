{"title": "EmoTag -Towards an Emotion-Based Analysis of Emojis", "abstract": "Despite being a fairly recent phenomenon, emojis have quickly become ubiquitous. Besides their extensive use in social media, they are now also invoked in customer surveys and feedback forms. Hence, there is a need for techniques to understand their sentiment and emotion. In this work, we provide a method to quantify the emotional association of basic emotions such as anger, fear, joy, and sadness for a set of emojis. We collect and process a unique corpus of 20 million emoji-centric tweets, such that we can capture rich emoji semantics using a comparably small dataset. We evaluate the induced emotion profiles of emojis with regard to their ability to predict word affect intensities as well as sentiment scores.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction In recent

referring to the lowest degree."}, {"id": 200, "string": "Note that this ground truth resource is distinct from the NRC Emotion Lexicon used in inducing our scores."}, {"id": 201, "string": "The latter merely provides Boolean labels for word-emotion pairs, and thus it is non-trivial to derive affect intensity scores from it, particularly via emojis."}, {"id": 202, "string": "To reproduce word emotion intensities based on our emoji emotion scores, we proceed as follows."}, {"id": 203, "string": "For a given word w, we rank the top K emojis based on their similarity score in the EmoTag word vectors, where higher scores entail a higher rank."}, {"id": 204, "string": "Once the top K emojis have been identified, we then compute the arithmetic mean of the emotion scores of those related emojis, which yields the final emotion score for the target word w.

the highest score 0.485 for the emotion joy, which is labeled as being in the joy category in their study as well."}, {"id": 217, "string": "There are three cases (high- Table 8 : Pearson Correlations

\"Weary Face\" U+1F629 should have obtained its highest score for sadness (0.234) instead of anger (0.236), though both scores are very close in our case."}, {"id": 219, "string": "The emoji \"Face With Tears of Joy\" U+1F602 scored 0.381 on anger, which is the highest among all scores for it, although the authors of Emoji2Emotion marked it as belonging to the joy category."}, {"id": 220,

appear together very often, which results in a strong association with a negative emotion (anger) for an emoji that intrinsically ought to be more associated with joy."}, {"id": 222, "string":

that make face-to-face communication particularly effective for problem-solving (Bordia, 1997) , modern social media, and messaging platforms have unique properties that are interesting in their own right."}, {"id": 224, "string": "Among these, the use of emojis stands out as meriting very special consideration, not least due to their ability to compensate for some of the shortcomings of written language as a medium in conveying emotion and affect."}, {"id": 225, "string": "While research in social science and social media analytics has extensively studied the use of emojis in everyday communication, previous work has not fully explored the connection between emojis and emotion."}, {"id": 226, "string": "This paper presents a detailed analysis of how emojis and words co-occur in social media, including their connection to emotions."}, {"id": 227, "string": "It also shows how an interpretable word embedding can be formed with the help of emojis, which shows promise as an additional ingredient in emotion detection-related tasks."}, {"id": 228, "string": "Another key contribution of this work is the creation of a large resource, consisting of several different sub-lexicons that describe connections among emoji, words, and other items, as well as emotion scores for emojis, which are released to the public 2 ."}, {"id": 229, "string": "We hence believe that
