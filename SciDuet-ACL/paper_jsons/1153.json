{"title": "Disambiguating False-Alarm Hashtag Usages in Tweets for Irony Detection", "abstract": "The reliability of self-labeled data is an important issue when the data are regarded as ground-truth for training and testing learning-based models. This paper addresses the issue of false-alarm hashtags in the self-labeled data for irony detection. We analyze the ambiguity of hashtag usages and propose a novel neural networkbased model, which incorporates linguistic information from different aspects, to disambiguate the usage of three hashtags that are widely used to collect the training data for irony detection. Furthermore, we apply our model to prune the self-labeled training data. Experimental results show that the irony detection model trained on the less but cleaner training instances outperforms the models trained on all data.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Self-labeled data available on the Internet are popular research materials in many NLP areas."}, {"id": 1, "string": "Metadata such as tags and emoticons given by users are considered as labels for training and testing learning-based models, which usually benefit from large amount of data."}, {"id": 2, "string": "One of the sources of self-labeled data widely used in the research community is Twitter, where the short-text messages tweets written by the crowd are publicly shared."}, {"id": 3, "string": "In a tweet, the author can tag the short text with some hashtags such as #excited, #happy, #UnbornLivesMatter, and #Hillary4President to express their emotion or opinion."}, {"id": 4, "string": "The tweets with a certain types of hashtags are collected as self-label data in a variety of research works including sentiment analysis (Qadir and Riloff, 2014) , stance detection (Mohammad et al., 2016;
