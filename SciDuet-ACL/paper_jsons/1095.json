{"title": "Massively Multilingual Transfer for NER", "abstract": "In cross-lingual transfer, NLP models over one or more source languages are applied to a lowresource target language. While most prior work has used a single source model or a few carefully selected models, here we consider a \"massive\" setting with many such models. This setting raises the problem of poor transfer, particularly from distant languages. We propose two techniques for modulating the transfer, suitable for zero-shot or few-shot learning, respectively. Evaluating on named entity recognition, we show that our techniques are much more effective than strong baselines, including standard ensembling, and our unsupervised method rivals oracle selection of the single best individual model. 1 * Both authors contributed equally to this work. 1  The code and the datasets will be made available at https://github.com/afshinrahimi/mmner.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Supervised learning remains king in natural language processing, with most tasks requiring large quantities of annotated corpora."}, {"id": 1, "string": "The majority of the world's 6,000+ languages however have limited or no annotated text, and therefore much of the progress in NLP has yet to be realised widely."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Cross-lingual transfer learning is a technique which can compensate for the dearth of data, by transferring knowledge from high-to lowresource languages, which has typically taken the form of annotation projection over parallel corpora or other multilingual resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001;
