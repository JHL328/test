{"title": "Tackling the Story Ending Biases in The Story Cloze Test", "abstract": "The Story Cloze Test (SCT) is a recent framework for evaluating story comprehension and script learning. There have been a variety of models tackling the SCT so far. Although the original goal behind the SCT was to require systems to perform deep language understanding and commonsense reasoning for successful narrative understanding, some recent models could perform significantly better than the initial baselines by leveraging human-authorship biases discovered in the SCT dataset. In order to shed some light on this issue, we have performed various data analysis and analyzed a variety of top performing models presented for this task. Given the statistics we have aggregated, we have designed a new crowdsourcing scheme that creates a new SCT dataset, which overcomes some of the biases. We benchmark a few models on the new dataset and show that the topperforming model on the original SCT dataset fails to keep up its performance. Our findings further signify the importance of benchmarking NLP systems on various evolving test sets.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Story comprehension has been one of the

that overcomes the data collection biases, while keeping the original evaluation format."}, {"id": 62, "string": "As the data analysis revealed, the token count, sentiment, and the complexity are not as important features for classification as the ending n-grams are."}, {"id": 63, "string": "We set the following goals for sourcing the new 'right' and 'wrong' endings."}, {"id": 64, "string": "They

restrictions."}, {"id": 73, "string": "This was done by taking the first four sentences of the newly collected stories and asking an MTurker to write a 'right' and 'wrong' ending for each."}, {"id": 74, "string": "The new restrictions were: 'Each sentence should stay within the same subject area of the story,' and 'The number of words in the Right and Wrong sentences should not differ by more than 2 words,' and 'When possible, the Right and Wrong sentences should try to keep a similar tone/sentiment as one another.'"}, {"id": 75, "string": "The motivation behind this technique was to reduce the statistical differences by asking the user to be mindful of considerations."}, {"id": 76, "string": "In Method #2, we took the five sentences stories and prompted a second set of MTurk workers to modify the fifth sentence in order to make a resulting five-sentence story non-sensible."}, {"id": 77, "string": "Here, the prompt instructs the workers to make sure the new 'wrong ending' sentence makes sense standalone, that it does not differ in the number of words from the original sentence by more than three words, and that the changes cannot be as simple as e.g., putting the word 'not' in front of a description or a verb."}, {"id": 78, "string": "As a result, the workers had much less flexibility for changing the underlying linguistic structures which can help tackle the authorship style differences between the 'right' and 'wrong' endings."}, {"id": 79, "string": "The results in Table 4 , which show classification accuracy when using EndingReg on the two new data sources, show that Method #2 is a slightly better data sourcing scheme in reducing the bias, since the EndingReg model's performance is slightly worse."}, {"id": 80, "string": "The set was further filtered through human verification similar to Mostafazadeh et al."}, {"id": 81, "string": "(2016) ."}, {"id": 82, "string": "The filtering was done by splitting each SCT-v1.0's two alternative endings into two independent five-sentence stories and asking three different MTurk users to categorize the story as either: one where the story made complete sense, one where the story made sense until the last sentence and one where the story does not make sense for another reason."}, {"id": 83, "string": "Stories were only selected if all the three MTurk users verified that the story with the 'right ending' and the corresponding story with the 'wrong ending' were verified to be indeed right and wrong respectively."}, {"id": 84, "string": "This ensured a higher quality of data and eliminating boundary cases."}, {"id": 85, "string": "This entire process resulted in creating the Story Cloze Test v1.5 (SCT-v1.5) dataset, consisting of 1,571 stories for each validation and test

improvement on the statistical weight of the stylistic features generated by the model."}, {"id": 91, "string": "Since the main features used are the token length and the various n-grams, this suggests that the new 'right endings' and 'wrong endings' have much more similar token n-gram, pos n-gram, postoken n-gram and char-gram overlap."}, {"id": 92, "string": "Furthermore, the CogComp model's performance has significantly dropped on SCT-v1.5."}, {"id": 93, "string": "Although this model seems to be using story comprehension features such as event sequencing, since the endings are included in the sequences, the biases within the endings have influenced the predictions and the weak performance of the model in SCT-v1.5 suggest that this model had picked up on the biases of SCT-v1.0 as opposed to really understanding the context."}, {"id": 94, "string": "In particular, the posterior probabilities for each ending choice using their features are quite similar on the SCT-v1.5."}, {"id": 95, "string": "These results place the classification accuracy of this top performing model on par with or worse than the models that did not use the ending features of the old SCT-v1.0 dataset (Mostafazadeh et al., 2017) , which suggest that the gap that once was held by models using the ending biases seems to be corrected for."}, {"id": 96, "string": "Al-   though we did not get to test all the other models published on SCT-v1.0 directly, we predict similar trends."}, {"id": 97, "string": "It is important to point out that the 64.4% performance attained by our EndingReg model is still high for a model which completely discards the context."}, {"id": 98, "string": "This indicates that although we could correct for some of the stylistic biases, there are some other hidden patterns in the new endings that would not have been accounted for without having the EndingReg baseline."}, {"id": 99, "string": "This showcases the importance of maintaining benchmarks that evolve and improve over time, where systems should not be optimized for particular narrow test sets."}, {"id": 100, "string": "We propose the community to report accuracies on both SCT-v1.0 and SCT-v1.5, both of which still have a huge gap between the best system and the human performance."}, {"id": 101, "string": "Conclusion In this paper, we presented a comprehensive analysis of the stylistic features isolated in the endings of the original Story Cloze Test (SCT-v1.0)."}, {"id": 102, "string": "Using that analysis, along with a classifier we developed for testing new data collection schemes, we created a new SCT dataset, SCT-v1.5, which overcomes some of the biases."}, {"id": 103, "string": "Based on the results presented in this paper, we believe that our SCT-v1.5 is a better benchmark for story comprehension."}, {"id": 104, "string": "However, as shown in multiple AI tasks (Ettinger et al., 2017; Antol et al., 2015; Jabri et al., 2016; Poliak et al., 2018) , no
