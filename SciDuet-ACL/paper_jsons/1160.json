{"title": "Parallelizable Stack Long Short-Term Memory", "abstract": "Stack Long Short-Term Memory (StackL-STM) is useful for various applications such as parsing and string-to-tree neural machine translation, but it is also known to be notoriously difficult to parallelize for GPU training due to the fact that the computations are dependent on discrete operations. In this paper, we tackle this problem by utilizing state access patterns of StackLSTM to homogenize computations with regard to different discrete operations. Our parsing experiments show that the method scales up almost linearly with increasing batch size, and our parallelized PyTorch implementation trains significantly faster compared to the Dynet C++ implementation.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Tree-structured representation of language has been successfully applied to various applications including dependency parsing (Dyer et al.,

"Parallelizable StackLSTM Continuing the formulation in the previous section, we will start by discussing our proposed solution under the case where the set of discrete actions contains only Push and

Pop operations is conducting the extra computations needed for Push operation when Pop is fed in as well, while guaranteeing the correctness of the resulting hidden state both in the current time step and in the future."}, {"id": 22, "string": "The next observation points out a way for this guarantee: Observation 2 In a StackLSTM, given the current stack top pointer position p(H), any hidden state h i where i > p(H) will not be read until it is overwritten by a Push operation."}, {"id": 23, "string": "What follows from this observation is the guarantee that we can always safely overwrite hidden states h i that are indexed higher than the current stack top pointer, because it is known that any read operation on these states will happen after another overwrite."}, {"id": 24, "string": "This allows us to do the extra computation anyway when Pop operation is fed, because the extra computation, especially updating h p(H)+1 , will not harm the validity of the hidden states at any time

81, "string": "In other words, there is no need for us to directly maintain all the intermediate stack top elements, because in PyTorch, when the element in the stack is re-written, its underlying sub-tensor will not be destructed as there are still nodes in the computation graph that point to it."}, {"id": 82, "string": "Hence, when performing back-propagation, the gradient is still able to flow back to the elements that are previously popped from the stack and their respective precedents."}, {"id": 83, "string": "Hence, we are also effectively storing all the intermediate stack top elements only once."}, {"id": 84, "string": "Besides, Bowman et al."}, {"id": 85, "string": "(2016) didn't attempt to eliminate the conditional branches in the StackLSTM algorithm, which is the main
