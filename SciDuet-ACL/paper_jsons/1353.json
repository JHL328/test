{"title": "A Stylometric Inquiry into Hyperpartisan and Fake News", "abstract": "We report on a comparative style analysis of hyperpartisan (extremely one-sided) news and fake news. A corpus of 1,627 articles from 9 political publishers, three each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left, and the hyperpartisan right, have been fact-checked by professional journalists at BuzzFeed: 97% of the 299 fake news articles identified are also hyperpartisan. We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F 1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F 1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F 1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share significantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been confirmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way. Applications of our results include partisanship detection and pre-screening for semi-automatic fake news detection.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction The media and the public are currently

others."}, {"id": 189, "string": "This result hence matches the findings of the previous experiments."}, {"id": 190, "string": "With caution, we conclude that the evidence gained from our three independent experimental setups supports our hypothesis that the hyperpartisan left and the hyperpartisan right have more in common in terms of writing style than any of the two have with the

in particular the high recall of 0.89 at a reasonable precision of 0.69 gives us confidence that, with some further effort, a practical classifier can be built that detects hyperpartisan news at scale

classifier for hyperpartisan news can act as a prefilter for a subsequent, more in-depth fake news detection approach, which may in turn be tailored to a much more narrowly defined classification

match facts with a knowledge base, to dynamically retrieve and maintain knowledge bases from the web, to reliably assess the overall veracity of an entire article rather than individual statements, to

{"id": 228, "string": "We show that news articles conveying a hyperpartisan world view can be distinguished from more balanced news by writing style alone."}, {"id": 229, "string": "Moreover, for the first time, we found quantifiable evidence that the writing styles of news of the two opposing orientations are in fact very similar: there appears to be a common writing style of left and right extremism."}, {"id": 230, "string": "We further show that satire can be distinguished well from other news, ensuring that humor will not be outcast by fake news detection technology."}, {"id": 231, "string": "All of these results offer new, tangible, short-term avenues of development, lest large-scale fact-checking is still far out of reach."}, {"id": 232, "string": "Employed as pre-filtering technologies to separate hyperpartisan news from mainstream news, our approach allows for directing the attention of human fact checkers to the most likely sources of fake news."}], "headers":
