{"title": "Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks", "abstract": "Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Summarization is the task of condensing a piece of text to a shorter version that contains the main information from the original."}, {"id": 1, "string": "There are two broad approaches to summarization: extractive and abstractive."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Extractive methods assemble summaries exclusively from passages (usually whole sentences) taken directly from the source text, while abstractive methods may generate novel words and phrases not featured in the source text -as a human-written abstract usually does."}, {"id": 3, "string": "The extractive approach is easier, because copying large Original Text (truncated): lagos, nigeria (cnn) a day after winning nigeria's presidency, muhammadu buhari told cnn's christiane amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued nigeria and go after the root of the nation's unrest."}, {"id": 4, "string": "buhari said he'll \"rapidly give attention\" to curbing violence in the northeast part of nigeria, where the terrorist group boko haram operates."}, {"id": 5, "string": "by cooperating with neighboring nations chad, cameroon and niger, he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to nigeria's instability."}, {"id": 6, "string": "for the first time in nigeria's history, the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections."}, {"id": 7, "string": "buhari defeated incumbent goodluck jonathan by about 2 million votes, according to nigeria's independent national electoral commission."}, {"id": 8, "string": "the win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in africa's most populous nation."}, {"id": 9, "string": "Baseline Seq2Seq + Attention: UNK UNK says his administration is confident it will be able to destabilize nigeria's economy."}, {"id": 10, "string": "UNK says his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and other nigerians."}, {"id": 11, "string": "he says the country has long nigeria and nigeria's economy."}, {"id": 12, "string": "Pointer-Gen: muhammadu buhari says he plans to aggressively fight corruption in the northeast part of nigeria."}, {"id": 13, "string": "he says he'll \"rapidly give attention\" to curbing violence in the northeast part of nigeria."}, {"id": 14, "string": "he says his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals."}, {"id": 15, "string": "Pointer-Gen + Coverage: muhammadu buhari says he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued nigeria."}, {"id": 16, "string": "he says his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals."}, {"id": 17, "string": "the win comes after a long history of military rule, coups and botched attempts at democracy in africa's most populous nation."}, {"id": 18, "string": "Figure 1 : Comparison of output of 3 abstractive summarization models on a news article."}, {"id": 19, "string": "The baseline model makes factual errors, a nonsensical sentence and struggles with OOV words muhammadu buhari."}, {"id": 20, "string": "The pointer-generator model is accurate but repeats itself."}, {"id": 21, "string": "Coverage eliminates repetition."}, {"id": 22, "string": "The final summary is composed from several fragments."}, {"id": 23, "string": "chunks of text from the source document ensures baseline levels of grammaticality and accuracy."}, {"id": 24, "string": "On the other hand, sophisticated abilities that are crucial to high-quality summarization, such as paraphrasing, generalization, or the incorporation of real-world knowledge, are possible only in an abstractive framework (see Figure 5 )."}, {"id": 25, "string": "Due to the difficulty of abstractive summarization, the great majority of past work has been extractive (Kupiec et al., 1995;
