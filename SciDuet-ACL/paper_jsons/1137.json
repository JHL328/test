{"title": "Introducing a Lexicon of Verbal Polarity Shifters for English", "abstract": "The sentiment polarity of a phrase does not only depend on the polarities of its words, but also on how these are affected by their context. Negation words (e.g. not, no, never) can change the polarity of a phrase. Similarly, verbs and other content words can also act as polarity shifters (e.g. fail, deny, alleviate). While individually more sparse, they are far more numerous. Among verbs alone, there are more than 1200 shifters. However, sentiment analysis systems barely consider polarity shifters other than negation words. A major reason for this is the scarcity of lexicons and corpora that provide information on them. We introduce a lexicon of verbal polarity shifters that covers the entirety of verbs found in WordNet. We provide a fine-grained annotation of individual word senses, as well as information for each verbal shifter on the syntactic scopes that it can affect.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction

31, "string": "In subsequent research, the term shifter has since mostly been applied to the case of lexical items that influence polarity."}, {"id": 32, "string": "Further, the notion of shifting is

situation that the speaker expected fails to occur or hold."}, {"id": 45, "string": "When this situation is part of a binary opposition (dead -alive), one can firmly conclude that the complementary state of affairs holds (not dead \u21d2 alive)."}, {"id": 46, "string": "In cases where the negation affects a scalar notion, which is common in evaluative contexts, the understanding that arises depends on which kinds of scalar inferences and default assumptions are made in the context (Paradis and Willners, 2006) ."}, {"id": 47, "string": "Thus, not good denies the applicability of an evaluation in the region of good or better, but leaves open just how far in the direction of badness the actual interpretation lies: \"It wasn't good\" may be continued with \"but it was ok\" to yield
