{"title": "A Multi-lingual Multi-task Architecture for Low-resource Sequence Labeling", "abstract": "We propose a multi-lingual multi-task architecture to develop supervised models with a minimal amount of labeled data for sequence labeling. In this new architecture, we combine various transfer models using two layers of parameter sharing. On the first layer, we construct the basis of the architecture to provide universal word representation and feature extraction capability for all models. On the second level, we adopt different parameter sharing strategies for different transfer schemes. This architecture proves to be particularly effective for low-resource settings, when there are less than 200 training sentences for the target task. Using Name Tagging as a target task, our approach achieved 4.3%-50.5% absolute Fscore gains compared to the mono-lingual single-task baseline model. 1 #1 [DUTCH]: If a Palestinian State is, however,

Table 6 shows, adding each component usually enhances the performance (F-score, %), while the impact also depends on the size of the target task data."}, {"id": 167, "string": "For example, the language-specific layer slightly impairs the performance with only 10 training sentences."}, {"id": 168, "string": "However, this is unsurpris-ing as it introduces additional parameters that are only

summarization (Isonuma et al., 2017) and sequence labeling (Collobert and Weston, 2008; S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg, 2016; Rei, 2017; Peng and Dredze, 2017; Yang et al., 2017; von D\u00e4niken and

architecture to transfer different types of knowledge from multiple auxiliary tasks simultaneously."}, {"id": 183, "string": "In addition, because our model is designed for lowresource settings, we share components among models in a different way (e.g., the LSTM layer is shared across all models)."}, {"id": 184, "string": "Differing from most MTL models, which perform supervisions for all tasks on the outermost layer, (S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg, 2016) proposes an MTL model which supervised tasks at different levels."}, {"id": 185, "string": "It shows that supervising low-level tasks such as
