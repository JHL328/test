{"title": "Integrating Case Frame into Japanese to Chinese Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation Model", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based (HP-B) machine translation systems with case frame (CF).we integrate the Japanese shallow CF into both rule extraction and decoding. All of these rules are then employed to decode new sentences in Japanese with source language case frame. The results of experiments carried out on Japanese-Chinese test sets. It shows that our approach maintains the advantages of HPB translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates CF constraints. The case frame rules can complement Hiero-style rules.
