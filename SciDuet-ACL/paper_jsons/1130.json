{"title": "A High Coverage Method for Automatic False Friends Detection for Spanish and Portuguese", "abstract": "False friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but have different meanings. They are a common source of confusion among language learners. Methods to detect them automatically do exist, however they make use of large aligned bilingual corpora, which are hard to find and expensive to build, or encounter problems dealing with infrequent words. In this work we propose a high coverage method that uses word vector representations to build a false friends classifier for any pair of languages, which we apply to the particular case of Spanish and Portuguese. The required resources are a large corpus for each language and a small bilingual lexicon for the pair. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

software Apertium 3 : we take one of the pair words, translate it and check if the translation matches the other word."}, {"id": 113, "string": "We chose this software since it can be accessed offline and it is freely available."}, {"id": 114, "string": "Apart from this, we compare with Sep\u00falveda and Alu\u00edsio (2011, experiment 2 and 3.2) method and also with a variant of our method that adds a word frequency feature (the relative number of times each word appeared in the corpus)."}, {"id": 115, "string": "Word frequencies are used by other authors and we believe they are a different data source from what the word2vec vectors can provide."}, {"id": 116, "string": "For these experiments we use the same data set as in (Sep\u00falveda and Alu\u00edsio, 2011) ."}, {"id": 117,

people."}, {"id": 121, "string": "It is important to consider that the word coverage is a concern in this task since every method can only works when the pair words are present in their resources (in other words, they are not out of a method's vocabulary)."}, {"id": 122, "string": "The accuracy thus only takes into account the covered pairs."}, {"id": 123, "string": "The coverage for the simple baseline can be measured by counting the pairs were both words are present in WordNet."}, {"id": 124, "string": "Sep\u00falveda and Alu\u00edsio (2011, experiment 2) only considers orthographic and phonetic differences, so always covers all pairs."}, {"id": 125, "string": "Sep\u00falveda and Alu\u00edsio (2011, experiment 3 .2) uses a dictionary, then the pairs that are in it count towards the coverage."}, {"id": 126, "string": "The words that could not be translated by Apertium are counted against the coverage of its related method."}, {"id": 127, "string": "Finally, the pairs that cannot be translated into vectors are counted as not covered by our methods."}, {"id": 128, "string": "Results are shown in Table 1 ."}, {"id": 129, "string": "It can be appreciated that our method provides both high accuracy and coverage, and that word embedding information can be further improved if additional information, such as the word frequencies, is included."}, {"id": 130, "string": "We also tested a version of our method that only uses Feature 1 via logistic regression, which reduced the accuracy by 3% roughly, showing that the other two features add some missing information to improve the accuracy."}, {"id": 131, "string": "As an additional experiment, we tried exploiting  WordNet to compute taxonomy-based distances as features in the same manner as Mitkov et al."}, {"id": 132,

space dimensions."}, {"id": 135, "string": "We also experimented with vectors for phrases up to two words."}, {"id": 136, "string": "Finally, we evaluated how the election of the source language,

(with Spanish as source and 100 as the vector dimension), summing up 33 configurations in total."}, {"id": 139, "string": "As it can be noted, there are no significant differences in the accuracy of our method when varying the vector sizes."}, {"id": 140, "string": "Higher dimensions do not provide better results and they even worsen when the target language dimension is greater than or equal to the source language dimension, as Mikolov et al."}, {"id": 141, "string": "(2013b) claimed."}, {"id": 142, "string": "Taking Spanish as the source language seems to be better, maybe this is due to the corpus sizes: the corpus used to generate the Spanish vector space is 1.4 times larger than the one used for Portuguese."}, {"id": 143, "string": "Finally, we can observe that including vectors for two-word phrases does not improve results."}, {"id": 144, "string": "Linear Transformation Analysis We were intrigued in knowing how different qualities and quantities of bilingual lexicon entries would affect our method performance."}, {"id": 145, "string": "We show how the accuracy varies according to the bilingual lexicon size and its source in the Fig."}, {"id": 146, "string": "3 ."},

than a thousand entries, and : Accuracy of our method with respect to different bilingual lexicon sizes and sources."}, {"id": 149, "string": "WN is the original approach we take to build the bilingual lexicon, WN all is a method that takes every pair of lemmas from both languages in every WordNet synset and Apertium uses the translations of the top 50,000 Spanish words in frequencies from the Wikipedia (and that could be translated to Portuguese)."}, {"id": 150, "string": "Note that the usage of Apertium here has nothing to do with Apertium baseline."}, {"id": 151, "string": "yield stable results when the number of entries is larger."}, {"id": 152, "string": "This is not the case for the method WN all, which needs more word pairs to achieve reasonable results (around 5,000) and it is less stable with larger number of entries."}, {"id": 153, "string": "Even though we use WordNet to build the lexicon, which is a rich and expensive resource, it could also be built with less quality entries, such as those that come from the output of a Machine Translation software or just by having a list of known word translations."}, {"id": 154, "string": "Furthermore, our method proved to work with a small number of word pairs, it can be applied to language pairs with scarce bilingual resources."}, {"id": 155, "string": "Additionally, it is interesting to observe that despite the fact that some test set pairs may appear in the bilingual lexicon in which our method is based on, when having changed it (by reducing its size or using Apertium), it still shows great performance."}, {"id": 156, "string": "This suggest the results are not biased towards the test set used in this work."}, {"id": 157, "string": "Conclusions and Future Work We have provided an approach to classify false friends and cognates which showed to have both high accuracy and coverage, studying it for the particular case of Spanish and Portuguese and providing state-of-the-art results for this pair of languages."}, {"id": 158, "string": "Here we use up-to-date word embedding techniques, which have shown to excel in other tasks, and which can be enriched with other information such as the words frequencies to enhance the classifier."}, {"id": 159, "string": "In the future we want to experiment with other word vector representations and state-of-the-art vector space linear transformation such as (Artetxe et al., 2017; Artetxe et al., 2018) ."}, {"id": 160, "string": "Also, we would like to work on fine-grained classifications, as we mentioned before there are some word pairs that behave like cognates in some cases but like false friends in others."}, {"id": 161, "string": "Our method can be applied to any pair of languages, without requiring a large bilingual corpus or taxonomy,
