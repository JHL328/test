{"title": "Bringing replication and reproduction together with generalisability in NLP: Three reproduction studies for Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Lack of repeatability and generalisability are two significant threats to continuing scientific development in Natural Language Processing. Language models and learning methods are so complex that scientific conference papers no longer contain enough space for the technical depth required for replication or reproduction. Taking Target Dependent Sentiment Analysis as a case study, we show how recent work in the field has not consistently released code, or described settings for learning methods in enough detail, and lacks comparability and generalisability in train, test or validation data. To investigate generalisability and to enable state of the art comparative evaluations, we carry out the first reproduction studies of three groups of complementary methods and perform the first large-scale mass evaluation on six different English datasets. Reflecting on our experiences, we recommend that future replication or reproduction experiments should always consider a variety of datasets alongside documenting and releasing their methods and published code in order to minimise the barriers to both repeatability and generalisability. We have released our code with a model zoo on GitHub with Jupyter Notebooks to aid understanding and full documentation, and we recommend that others do the same with their papers at submission time through an anonymised GitHub account.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Repeatable (replicable and/or reproducible 1 ) experimentation is a core tenet of the scientific endeavour."}, {"id":

network/deep learning approach of Tang et al."}, {"id": 184, "string": "(2016a) we agree with Reimers and Gurevych (2017) that reporting multiple runs of the system over different seed values is required as the single performance scores can be misleading, which could explain why previous papers obtained different results to the original for the TDLSTM method (Chen et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2017) ."}, {"id": 185, "string": "Mass Evaluation For all of the methods we pre-processed the text by lower casing and tokenising using Twokenizer (Gimpel et al., 2011) , and we used all three sentiment lexicons where applicable."}, {"id": 186, "string": "We found the best word vectors from SSWE and the common crawl 42B 300 dimension Glove vectors by five fold stratified cross validation for the NP methods and the highest accuracy on the validation set for the LSTM methods."}, {"id": 187, "string": "We chose these word vectors as they have very different sizes (50 and 300), also they

quicker and computationally less expensive, we filtered out all words from the word vectors that did not appear in the train and test datasets, and this is equivalent with respect to word coverage as using all words."}, {"id": 189, "string": "Finally we only reported results for the LSTM methods with one seed value and not multiple due to time constraints."}, {"id": 190, "string": "The results of the methods using the best found word vectors on the test sets can be seen in table 6."}, {"id": 191, "string": "We find that the TDParse methods generally perform best but only clearly outperforms the other nondependency parser methods on the YouTuBean dataset."}, {"id": 192, "string": "We hypothesise that this is due to the dataset containing, on average, a deeper constituency tree depth which could be seen as on average more complex sentences."}, {"id": 193, "string": "This could be due to it being from the spoken medium compared to the rest of the datasets which are written."}, {"id":

performs the best indicating that the extra target information that the TCLSTM method contains is not needed, but we believe this needs further analysis."}, {"id": 196, "string": "We can conclude that

that improved repeatability practices are adopted."}, {"id": 201, "string": "The practices adopted in our case studies are to reproduce the methods in open source code, adopt only open data, provide format conversion tools to ingest the different data formats, and describe and document all settings via the code and Jupyter Notebooks (released initially in anonymous form at submission time) 12

should be brought together."}, {"id": 203, "string": "In future work, we aim to extend our reproduction framework further, and extend the comparative evaluation to languages other than English."},
