{"title": "A Crowdsourced Frame Disambiguation Corpus with Ambiguity", "abstract": "We present a resource for the task of FrameNet semantic frame disambiguation of over 5,000 word-sentence pairs from the Wikipedia corpus. The annotations were collected using a novel crowdsourcing approach with multiple workers per sentence to capture interannotator disagreement. In contrast to the typical approach of attributing the best single frame to each word, we provide a list of frames with disagreement-based scores that express the confidence with which each frame applies to the word. This is based on the idea that inter-annotator disagreement is at least partly caused by ambiguity that is inherent to the text and frames. We have found many examples where the semantics of individual frames overlap sufficiently to make them acceptable alternatives for interpreting a sentence. We have argued that ignoring this ambiguity creates an overly arbitrary target for training and evaluating natural language processing systemsif humans cannot agree, why would we expect the correct answer from a machine to be any different? To process this data we also utilized an expanded lemma-set provided by the Framester system, which merges FN with WordNet to enhance coverage. Our dataset includes annotations of 1,000 sentence-word pairs whose lemmas are not part of FN. Finally we present metrics for evaluating frame disambiguation systems that account for ambiguity.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Crowdsourcing has been a popular method to collect

many words have multiple possible meanings."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Using domain experts for frame disambiguation is expensive and time consuming, resulting in small corpora for this task that do not scale well for modern machine learning methods -FN version 1.7, the latest one at the time of writing, contains only about 10,000 sentences annotated with frames."}, {"id": 6, "string": "Furthermore, only using one expert to perform the annotation makes it difficult to capture any diversity of perspectives."}, {"id": 7, "string": "There have been a number of small-scale attempts at using crowdsourcing for frame disambiguation in sentences, showing that the crowd has comparable performance to the FN domain experts (Hong and Baker, 2011) , and that the crowd can be used to correct wrong

frame disambiguation, disagreement cases are often caused by ambiguity, such as vague or overlapping frame definitions, or incomplete information in the sentence."}, {"id": 11, "string": "Because of these issues with the input data, the approach of selecting one single correct frame for every word, and ignoring alternative interpretations, often results in arbitrary, incomplete ground truth corpora."}, {"id": 12, "string": "In order to aggregate annotated data while preserving disagreement, we use the CrowdTruth method 1 (Aroyo and Welty, 2014) , which encourages using multiple crowd
