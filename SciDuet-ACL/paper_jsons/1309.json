{"title": "Unpaired Sentiment-to-Sentiment Translation: A Cycled Reinforcement Learning Approach", "abstract": "The goal of sentiment-to-sentiment \"translation\" is to change the underlying sentiment of a sentence while keeping its content. The main challenge is the lack of parallel data. To solve this problem, we propose a cycled reinforcement learning method that enables training on unpaired data by collaboration between a neutralization module and an emotionalization module. We evaluate our approach on two review datasets, Yelp and Amazon. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. Especially, the proposed method substantially improves the content preservation performance.
