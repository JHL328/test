{"title": "Automatic Estimation of Simultaneous Interpreter Performance", "abstract": "Simultaneous interpretation, translation of the spoken word in real-time, is both highly challenging and physically demanding. Methods to predict interpreter confidence and the adequacy of the interpreted message have a number of potential applications, such as in computerassisted interpretation interfaces or pedagogical tools. We propose the task of predicting simultaneous interpreter performance by building on existing methodology for quality estimation (QE) of machine translation output. In experiments over five settings in three language pairs, we extend a QE pipeline to estimate interpreter performance (as approximated by the METEOR evaluation metric) and propose novel features reflecting interpretation strategy and evaluation measures that further improve prediction accuracy. 1", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) is an inherently

automatically predicting when interpreters are interpreting smoothly and when they are struggling."}, {"id": 5, "string": "This has several immediate potential applications, one of which being in Computer-Assisted Interpretation (CAI)."}, {"id": 6, "string": "CAI is quickly gaining traction in the interpreting community, with software products such as Interpret-Bank (Fantinouli, 2016) deployed in interpreting booths to provide live and interactive terminology support."}, {"id": 7, "string": "Figure 1 (b) shows how this might work; both the interpreter and the CAI system receive the source message and the system displays assistive information in the form of terminology and informational support."}, {"id": 8, "string": "While this might improve the quality of interpreter output, there is a danger that these systems will provide too much information and increase the cognitive load imposed upon the interpreter (Fantinouli, 2018) ."}, {"id": 9, "string": "Intuitively, the ideal level of support depends on current interpreter performance."}, {"id": 10, "string": "The system can minimize distraction by providing assistance only when an interpreter is struggling."}, {"id": 11, "string": "This level of support could be moderated appropriately if interpreter performance can be accurately predicted."}, {"id": 12, "string": "Figure 1 (c) demonstrates how our proposed quality estimation (QE) system receives and evaluates interpreter output, allowing the CAI system to appropriately lower the amount of information passed to the interpreter, maximizing the quality of interpreter

economizing strategies such as segmentation, omission, generalization, and reformulation (Riccardi, 2005) ."}, {"id": 54, "string": "As such, measuring interpretation quality by some metrics employed in MT such as BLEU can result in artificially low scores (Shimizu et al., 2013) ."}, {"id": 55, "string": "To mitigate this, we use METEOR, a more sophisticated MT evaluation metric that considers
