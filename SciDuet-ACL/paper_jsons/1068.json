{"title": "NICT at WAT 2015", "abstract": "Translation systems of our NICT team at the 2nd Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT 2015) are described in this paper. We participated in two translation tasks: Japanese-to-English (JE) and Korean-to-Japanese (KJ). A baseline phrased-based (PB) statistical machine translation (SMT) system in Moses was used. On JE translation, two pre-reordering approaches were applied: a simple reverse preordering and a dependency-based approach. On KJ translation, the processing was purely conducted on character-level. Evaluation results show that even simple approaches can improve JE and KJ PB SMT significantly. These techniques can be easily applied in practice because of the simplicity. 42", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques have been well developed
