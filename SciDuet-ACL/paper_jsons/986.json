{"title": "Overview of the CL-SciSumm 2016 Shared Task", "abstract": "The CL-SciSumm 2016 Shared Task is the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization in the computational linguistics (CL) domain. The task built off of the experience and training data set created in its namesake pilot task, which was conducted in 2014 by the same organizing committee. The track included three tasks involving: (1A) identifying relationships between citing documents and the referred document, (1B) classifying the discourse facets, and (2) generating the abstractive summary. The dataset comprised 30 annotated sets of citing and reference papers from the open access research papers in the CL domain. This overview paper describes the participation and the official results of the second CL-SciSumm Shared Task, organized as a part of the Joint Workshop onBibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2016), held in New Jersey,USA in June, 2016.
