{"title": "Exemplar Encoder-Decoder for Neural Conversation Generation", "abstract": "In this paper we present the Exemplar Encoder-Decoder network (EED), a novel conversation model that learns to utilize similar examples from training data to generate responses. Similar conversation examples (context-response pairs) from training data are retrieved using a traditional TF-IDF based retrieval model. The retrieved responses are used to create exemplar vectors that are used by the decoder to generate the response. The contribution of each retrieved response is weighed by the similarity of corresponding context with the input context. We present detailed experiments on two large data sets and find that our method outperforms state of the art sequence to sequence generative models on several recently proposed evaluation metrics. We also observe that the responses generated by the proposed EED model are more informative and diverse compared to existing state-of-the-art method.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction With the availability of large datasets and the recent progress made by neural methods, variants of sequence to sequence learning (seq2seq) (Sutskever et al., 2014) architectures have been successfully applied for building conversational systems (Serban et al., , 2017b ."}, {"id": 1, "string": "However, despite these methods being the stateof-the art frameworks for conversation generation, they suffer from problems such as lack of diversity in responses and generation of short, repetitive and uninteresting responses (Liu et al., 2016; Serban et al., , 2017b ."}, {"id": 2, "string": "A large body of recent literature has focused on overcoming such challenges (Li et al., 2016a; Lowe et al., 2017) ."}, {"id": 3, "string": "In part, such problems arise as all information required to generate responses needs to be captured as part of the model parameters learnt from the training data."}, {"id": 4, "string": "These model parameters alone may not be sufficient for generating natural conversations."}, {"id": 5, "string": "Therefore, despite providing enormous amount of data, neural generative systems have been found to be ineffective for use in real world applications (Liu et al., 2016) ."}, {"id": 6, "string": "In this paper, we focus our attention on closed domain conversations."}, {"id": 7, "string": "A characteristic feature of such conversations is that over a period of time, some conversation contexts 1 are likely to have occurred previously (Lu et al., 2017b) ."}, {"id": 8, "string": "For instance, Table 1 shows some contexts from the Ubuntu dialog corpus."}, {"id": 9, "string": "Each row presents an input dialog context with its corresponding gold response followed by a similar context and response seen in training data -as can be seen, contexts for \"installing dms\", \"sharing files\", \"blocking ufw ports\" have all occurred in training data."}, {"id": 10, "string": "We hypothesize that being able to refer to training responses for previously seen similar contexts could be a helpful signal to use while generating responses."}, {"id": 11, "string": "In order to exploit this aspect of closed domain conversations we build our neural encoderdecoder architecture called the Exemplar Encoder Decoder (EED), that learns to generate a response for a given context by exploiting similar contexts from training conversations."}, {"id": 12, "string": "Thus, instead of having the seq2seq model learn patterns of language only from aligned parallel corpora, we assist the model by providing it closely related (similar) samples from the training data that it can refer to while generating text."}, {"id": 13, "string": "Specifically, given a context c, we retrieve a set  of context-response pairs (c (k) , r (k) ), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 K using an inverted index of training data."}, {"id": 14, "string": "We create an exemplar vector e (k) by encoding the response r (k) (also referred to as exemplar response) along with an encoded representation of the current context c.
