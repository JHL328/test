{"title": "Joint Reasoning for Temporal and Causal Relations", "abstract": "Understanding temporal and causal relations between events is a fundamental natural language understanding task. Because a cause must occur earlier than its effect, temporal and causal relations are closely related and one relation often dictates the value of the other. However, limited attention has been paid to studying these two relations jointly. This paper presents a joint inference framework for them using constrained conditional models (CCMs). Specifically, we formulate the joint problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, enforcing constraints that are inherent in the nature of time and causality. We show that the joint inference framework results in statistically significant improvement in the extraction of both temporal and causal relations from text. 1", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Understanding events is an important component of natural language understanding."}, {"id": 1, "string": "An essential step in this process is identifying relations between events, which are needed in order to support applications such as story completion, summarization, and timeline construction."}, {"id": 2, "string": "Among the many relation types that could exist between events, this paper focuses on the joint extraction of temporal and causal relations."}, {"id": 3, "string": "It is well known that temporal and causal relations interact with each other and in many cases, the decision of one relation is made primarily based on evidence from the other."}, {"id": 4, "string": "In Example 1, identifying the temporal relation between e1:died and e2:exploded is 1 The dataset and code used in this paper are available at http://cogcomp.org/page/publication_ view/835 in fact a very hard case: There are no explicit temporal markers (e.g., \"before\", \"after\", or \"since\");
