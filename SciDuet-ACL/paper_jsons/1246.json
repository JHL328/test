{"title": "A Study of Reuse and Plagiarism in Speech and Natural Language Processing papers", "abstract": "The aim of this experiment is to present an easy way to compare fragments of texts in order to detect (supposed) results of copy & paste operations between articles in the domain of Natural Language Processing, including Speech Processing (NLP). The search space of the comparisons is a corpus labelled as NLP4NLP, which includes 34 different sources and gathers a large part of the publications in the NLP field over the past 50 years. This study considers the similarity between the papers of each individual source and the complete set of papers in the whole corpus, according to four different types of relationship (self-reuse, self-plagiarism, reuse and plagiarism) and in both directions: a source paper borrowing a fragment of text from another paper of the collection, or in the reverse direction, fragments of text from the source paper being borrowed and inserted in another paper of the collection.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction Everything starts with a copy & paste and, of course the flood of documents

of text from other papers of the NLP4NLP collection, in other words, a backward study, and we also study in the reverse direction the fragments of the source paper being borrowed by papers of the NLP4NLP collection, in other words, a forward study."}, {"id": 74, "string": "Algorithm Comparison of word sequences has proven to be an effective method for detection of copy For each document of the focus (the source corpus), all the sliding windows 12 of lemmas (typically 5 to 7, excluding punctuations) are built and recorded under the form of a character string key in an index locally to a document."}, {"id": 75, "string": "An index gathering all these local indexes is built and is called the \"focus index\"."}, {"id": 76, "string": "For each document apart from the focus (i.e."},

evaluation In a first implementation, we compared the raw character strings with a segmentation based on space and punctuation."}, {"id": 82, "string": "But, due to the fact that the input is the result of PDF formatting, the texts may contain variable caesura for line endings or some little textual variations."}, {"id": 83, "string": "Our objective is to compare at a higher level than hyphen variation (there are different sorts of hyphens), caesura (the sequence X/-/endOfLine/Y needs to match an entry XY in the lexicon to distinguish from an hyphen binding a composition), upper/lower case variation, plural, orthographic variation (\"normalise\" versus \"normalize\"), spellchecking (particularly useful when the PDF is an image and when the extraction is of low quality) and abbreviation (\"NP\" versus \"Noun Phrase\" or \"HMM\" versus \"Hidden Markov Model\")."}, {"id": 84, "string": "Some rubbish sequence of characters (e.g."}, {"id": 85, "string": "a series of hyphens) were also detected and cleaned."}, {"id": 86, "string": "Given that a parser takes all these variations and cleanings into account, we decided to apply a full linguistic parsing, as a second strategy."}, {"id": 87, "string": "The syntactic structures and relations are ignored."}, {"id": 88, "string": "Then a module for entity linking is called in order to bind different names referring to the same entity, a process often labeled as \"entity linking\" ."}, {"id": 89, "string": "Thus \"British National Corpus\" is considered as possibly abbreviated to \"BNC\", as well as less regular names like \"ItalWordNet\" possibly abbreviated to \"IWN\"."}, {"id": 90, "string": "Each entry of the Knowledge Base has a canonical form, possibly associated with different variants: the aim is to normalize into a canonical form to neutralize proper noun obfuscations based on variant substitutions."}, {"id": 91, "string": "After this processing, only the sentences with at least a verb are considered."},

strategy based on linguistic processing provides more pairs (+158) and we examined these differences."}, {"id": 95, "string": "Among these pairs, the vast majority (80%) concerns caesura: this is normal because most conferences demand a double column format, so the authors frequently use caesura to save place 13 ."}, {"id": 96, "string": "The other differences (20%) are mainly caused by lexical variations and spellchecking."}, {"id": 97, "string": "Thus, the results show that using raw texts gives a more \"silent\" system."}, {"id": 98, "string": "The drawback is that the computation is much longer 14 , but we think that it is worth the value."}, {"id": 99, "string": "Tuning parameters There are three parameters that had to be tuned: the window size, the distance function and the threshold."}, {"id": 100, "string": "The main problem we had was that we did not have any gold standard to evaluate the quality specifically on our corpus and the burden to annotate a corpus was too heavy."}, {"id": 101, "string": "We therefore decided to start from the parameters presented in the articles related to the PAN contest."}, {"id": 102, "string": "We then computed the results, picked a random selection of pairs that we examined and tuned the parameters accordingly."}, {"id": 103, "string": "All experiments were conducted with LREC as the focus and NLP4NLP as the search space."}, {"id": 104, "string": "In the PAN related articles, different window sizes are used."}, {"id": 105, "string": "A window of five is the most frequent one [Kasprzak et al 2010], but our results show that a lot of common sequences like \"the linguistic unit is the\" overload the pairwise score."}, {"id": 106, "string": "After some trials, we decided to select a size of seven tokens, in agreement with [Citron and Ginsparg 2014]."}, {"id": 107, "string": "Concerning the distance function, the Jaccard distance is frequently used but let's note that other formulas are applicable and documented in the literature."}, {"id": 108, "string": "For instance, some authors use an approximation with the following formula: score(D1,D2) = shared windows# / min(D1 windows#, D2 windows#) [Clough et al 2009], which is faster to compute, because there is no need to compute the union."}, {"id": 109, "string": "Given that computation time is not a problem for us, we kept the most used function which is the Jaccard distance."}, {"id": 110, "string": "Concerning the threshold, we tried thresholds of 0.03 and 0.04 (3 to 4%) and we compared the results."}, {"id": 111, "string": "The last value gave more significant results, as it reduced noise, while still allowing to detect meaningful pairs of similar papers."}, {"id": 112, "string": "After running the first trials, we discovered that using the Jaccard distance resulted in considering as similar a set of two papers, one of them being of small content."}, {"id": 113, "string": "This may be the case for invited talks, for example, when the author only provide a short abstract."}, {"id": 114, "string": "In this case, a simple acknowledgement to the same institution may produce a similarity score higher than the threshold."}, {"id": 115, "string": "The same happens for some eldest papers when the OCR produced a truncated document."}, {"id": 116, "string": "In order to solve this problem, we added a second threshold on the minimum number of shared windows that we set at 50 after considering the corresponding erroneous cases."}, {"id": 117, "string": "Special considerations concerning authorship and citations As previously explained, our aim is to distinguish a copy & paste fragment associated with a citation compared to a fragment without any citation."}, {"id": 118, "string": "To this end, we proceed with an approximation: we do not bind exactly the anchor in the text, but we parse the reference section and consider that, globally to the text, the document cites (or not) the other document."}, {"id": 119, "string": "Due to the fact, that we have proper author identification for each document, the corpus forms a complex web of citations."}, {"id": 120, "string": "We are thus able to distinguish self-reuse versus self-plagiarism and reuse versus plagiarism."}, {"id": 121, "string": "We are in a situation slightly different from METER where the references are not Precision about the anteriority test Given the fact that some papers and drafts of papers can circulate among researchers before the official published date, it is impossible to verify exactly when a document is issued; moreover we do not have any more detailed time indication than the year, as we don't know the precise date of submission."}, {"id": 122, "string": "This is why we also consider the same year within the comparisons."}, {"id": 123, "string": "In this case, it is difficult to determine which are the borrowing and borrowed papers, and in some cases they may even have been written simultaneously."},

authors do not quote the source paper, but these possible cases of plagiarism only represent 0.23% of the total number of papers."}, {"id": 164, "string": "Given those small numbers, we were able to conduct a manual checking of those couples."}, {"id": 165, "string": "Among the couple papers placed in the \"Reuse\" category, it appeared that 12 have a least one author in common, but with a somehow different spelling and should therefore be placed in the \"Self-reuse\" category."}, {"id": 166, "string": "Among the couples of papers placed in the \"Plagiarism\" category, 25 have a least one author in common, but with a somehow different spelling and should therefore be placed in the \"Self-plagiarism\" category and 14 correctly quote the source paper, but with variants in the spelling of the authors' names, of the paper's title or of the conference or journal source or forgetting to place the source paper in the references and should therefore be placed in the \"Reuse\"

"We found the following explanations: The paper cites another reference from the same authors of the source paper (typically a previous reference, or a paper published in a Journal) (46 cases) Both papers use extracts of a third paper that they both cite (31 cases) The authors of the two papers are different, but from the same laboratory (typically in industrial laboratories or funding agencies) (11 cases) The authors previously co-authored papers (typically as supervisor and PhD student or postdoc) but are now in a different laboratory (11 cases) The authors of the papers are different, but collaborated in the same project which is presented in the two papers (2 cases) The two papers present the same short example, result or definition coming from another source (13 cases) If we exclude those cases, only 3 cases of possible plagiarism remain that correspond to the same paper which appears as a patchwork of 3 other papers, while sharing several references with them."}, {"id": 169,

to 23% if the papers are published on the same year."}, {"id": 187, "string": "Plagiarism may raise legal issues if it violates copyright, but the right to quote 16 exists in certain conditions: \"National legislations usually embody the Berne convention limits in one or more of the following requirements: the cited paragraphs are within a reasonable limit, clearly marked as quotations and fully referenced, the resulting new work is not just a collection of quotations, but constitutes a fully original work in itself\", we could also add that the cited paragraph must have a function in the goal of the citing paper."}, {"id": 188, "string": "Obviously, most of the cases reported in this paper comply with the right to quote."}, {"id": 189, "string": "The limits of the cited paragraph vary from country to country."}, {"id": 190, "string": "In France and Canada, for example, a limit of 10% of both the copying and copied texts seems to be acceptable."}, {"id": 191, "string": "As we've seen, we stay within those limits in all cases in NLP4NLP."}, {"id": 192, "string": "Self-reuse and self-plagiarism are of a different nature."}, {"id": 193, "string": "Let's recall that they concern papers that have at least one author in common."}, {"id": 194, "string": "Of course, a copy & paste operation is easy and frequent but there is another phenomena to take into account which is difficult to distinguish from copy & paste: this is the style of the author."}, {"id": 195, "string": "Everybody has habits to formulate its ideas, and, even on a long period, most authors seem to keep the same chunks of prepared words."}, {"id": 196, "string": "As we've seen, almost 40% of the cases concern papers that are published on the same year: authors submit two similar papers at two different conferences on the same year, and publish the two papers in both conferences if both are accepted."}, {"id": 197, "string": "It is very difficult to prevent those cases as none of the papers are published when the other is submitted."}, {"id": 198, "string": "Another frequent case is the publication of a paper in a journal after its publication in a conference."}, {"id": 199, "string": "Here also, it is a natural and usual process, sometimes even encouraged by the journal editors after a pre-selection of the best papers in a conference."}, {"id": 200, "string": "As a tentative to moderate these figures and to justify self-reuse and self-plagiarism of previously published material, it is worth quoting Pamela Samuelson [Samuelson 1994]: The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work, Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments, The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out, The authors think they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time."}, {"id": 201, "string": "She considers that 30% is an upper limit in the reuse of parts of a previously published paper."}, {"id": 202, "string": "We believe that following these two sets of principles regarding (self) reuse and plagiarism will help maintaining an ethical behavior in our community."}, {"id": 203, "string": "Further developments A limitation of our approach is that it fails to identify copy & paste when the original text has been strongly altered."}, {"id": 204, "string": "Our study of graphical variations of a common meaning is presently limited to geographical variants, technical abbreviations (e.g."}, {"id": 205, "string": "HMM versus Hidden Markov Model) and resource names aliases from the LRE Map."}, {"id": 206, "string": "We plan to deal with \"rogeting\" which is the practice of replacing words with supposedly synonymous alternatives in order to disguise plagiarism 17 Another direction of improvement is to isolate and ignore tables in order to reduce noise, but this is a complex task as documented in [Frey et al 2015]."}, {"id": 207, "string": "Let's note that this is not a big problem in our approach, as we ignore sentences without any verb and as verbs are not very frequent within a table."}, {"id": 208, "string": "More generally, we could also study the position and rhetorical structure of the copy & paste in order to identify and justify their function."}, {"id": 209, "string": "We may finally explore whether copy & paste is more common for non native English speakers, given that it is frequent that they publish first in their native language at a national conference and then in English in an international conference or an international journal, in order to broaden their audience."}, {"id": 210, "string": "Conclusions To our knowledge, this paper is the first which reports results on the study of copy & paste operations on corpora of NLP archives of this size."}, {"id": 211, "string": "Based on a simple method of n-gram comparison after text processing using NLP, this method is easy to implement."}, {"id": 212, "string": "Of course, this process makes a large number of pairwise comparisons (65,000*65,000), which still represents a practical computing limitation."}, {"id": 213, "string": "As our measures show, self-reuse and self-plagiarism are common practices."}, {"id": 214, "string": "This is not specific to our field and is certainly related to the current tendency which is called \"salami-slicing\" publication caused by the publishand-perish demand 18 ."}, {"id": 215, "string": "But we gladly notice that plagiarism is very uncommon in our community."}], "headers": [{"section": "Introduction", "n": "1.", "start": 0, "end": 2}, {"section": "Context", "n": "2.", "start": 3, "end": 8}, {"section":
