{"title": "News clustering approach based on discourse text structure", "abstract": "A web search engine usually returns a long list of documents and it may be difficult for users to navigate through this collection and find the most relevant ones. We present an approach to post-retrieval snippet clustering based on pattern structures construction on augmented syntactic parse trees. Since an algorithm may be too slow for a typical collection of snippets, we propose a reduction method that allows us to construct a reduced pattern structure and make it scalable. Our algorithm takes into account discourse information to make clustering results independent of how information is distributed between sentences.", "text": [{"id": 0, "string": "Introduction and
